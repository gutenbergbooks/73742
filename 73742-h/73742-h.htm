<h2>Chapter I. <br> I Acquire a Friend</h2>

<p>High on the roof of the apartment house, in the
darkness, the insatiable, ceaseless murmur of the
city came hushed and muted to my ears. I
leaned against the parapet, staring out over the glow
of clashing lights below and letting the breeze touch my
face with its gentle fingers. It had a soothing influence
of which I was badly in need that night. For I had
come to the end of two months of ceaseless search—and
consistent, unvarying failure.</p>

<p>I had not dared to lose faith that somewhere down
there, in that brimming human river, still existed the
sweetest little sister a fellow ever had. It was possible
even that one of the little dots now passing in the
street far below knew where she was and what her fate
had been. But I, who would have given the aching
heart out of my body to find her, could not tell. I could
only remember her sweetness; her little wide-eyed
glances; her happy, bubbling laughter and her adorable
innocence.</p>

<p>Perhaps fate had been envious of our happiness
together, for it had played us the cruellest of tricks,
wresting my little sister away to God knew what horrors
and leaving me with a ceaseless, gnawing grief. My
imagination is none too vivid, perhaps, at ordinary times,
but during those two months I had had to school it
rigidly. A mind that is balked of a great desire, turns
on itself like a scorpion. But it did not help my search
to picture scenes in which she might be the victim, scenes
going on even at that moment and just around the corner
perhaps. And madness lay that way, as I had long since
had cause to realize.</p>

<p>Looking back, there on the roof, it seemed a weary
waste of years since that morning, only two months
before, when she came laughing, dancing into my studio to
ask her favor. A Mrs. Furneau, whom I knew slightly,
had offered to drive her into New York that day, to a
luncheon party at the house of some friends and a
<i>matinée</i> afterwards. Margaret was just seventeen, with
an innocent, slender, childlike beauty that set me nearly
crazy in my efforts to transfer it to canvas. She had
come home for the summer holidays, and as usual her
dainty wishes were my law. This party was to be a
“Special treat, please!” So I had let her go.</p>

<p>I gazed down at the darkened city, and for the
thousand-and-first time went wearily over the events of that
terrible time, seeking for the faintest clew.</p>

<p>The first intimation that I had had of impending
tragedy had come from Mrs. Furneau, the woman who had
taken Margaret into New York. I had been working
hard on a portrait and had hardly missed the child. But
about seven o’clock, an hour after she should have been
home, the telephone rang and a gasping voice came to
me over the long-distance wire: “Is Margaret with you?
Did she come home?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Furneau sounded nearly distracted, but I had
managed to drag the details out of her at length. They
had gone to the luncheon and then to the <i>matinée</i> in a
party, she told me. A little after five, they had left the
others and started for home in Mrs. Furneau’s car.
Then, at 34th Street, Margaret had begged for ten
minutes in which to do some shopping in one of the big stores
near by. Mrs. Furneau had agreed to wait for her, and
had pulled up in front of the store while Margaret got out
and ran inside. And that was all!</p>

<p>Mrs. Furneau had waited for nearly half an hour,
and then, as she could see that the store was closing for
the night, had gone inside to look for her. Not finding
her, she had returned to the car. But Margaret had
not come out, according to Mrs. Furneau’s chauffeur.
So she went back again and searched the nearly empty
store thoroughly this time. But she could learn
nothing—could find no one who had even seen the child.
Margaret had certainly entered the store, for the older woman
said she had watched her graceful figure until it passed
through the revolving doors. But after that she had
vanished!</p>

<p>Thinking that Margaret might have met and talked
with friends or gone to another store in search of what
she wanted, Mrs. Furneau had waited in the car for
nearly an hour more. By that time all the stores
were closed. And besides, Margaret was a considerate
child and would never have stayed away so long of her
own volition without telling her hostess. Mrs. Furneau
became really frightened then and telephoned to me.</p>

<p>Half an hour later I met her in New York. She
repeated the details of Margaret’s disappearance and
we talked over possibilities, but there was no clew to
work on, as to what could have become of my little
sister. We called up all the friends she had in New
York that I knew about, but could learn nothing. And
there was very little that I could do that night. The
store workers were scattered to the four winds by that
time.</p>

<p>So I had given all the details of the disappearance
to the police, and after sending Mrs. Furneau home—she
was frightened and tired out—I went to a hotel
myself, so that I could be close at hand if the police wanted
me.</p>

<p>As long as I live the recollection of that night will
be vivid in my memory. Hour after hour I paced the
floor, stopping every ten minutes or so to ring up my
house, only to learn from the frightened servants that
there was no news. Margaret had not returned. And
at last the gray dawn crept into the room and found
me still fully dressed and still pacing back and forth.</p>

<p>The store opened at nine, and at that hour Mrs.
Furneau, who had come into town again to help, joined
me. We went through the store together and
questioned the workers—door-men, floor-walkers,
salesgirls—every one. But we could learn nothing. There was
simply no trace of any kind.</p>

<p>And another hasty telephone call told me that there
was no news of my little sister at home.</p>

<p>That night and morning had been the beginning of
two months of fear that haunted me like the terrible
figments of a nightmare. At first, the number of
investigations that suggested themselves, among the
people in the store and among Margaret’s friends, had kept
my mind occupied and kept hope alive that nothing
serious had happened to the child. Then there had been the
hospitals to search and city officials to interview, to say
nothing of social workers and charitable organizations.
Mrs. Furneau spent days with me, helping in the search.
But as time passed and we could learn nothing, despair
settled on me like a choking cloud, and with it an
unreasonable sense of resentment towards Mrs. Furneau
for her part in it all. I did my best to conceal it; but
her intuition must have told her that there was something
wrong, and after a week or so she gave up the search and
I continued my efforts alone.</p>

<p>But the days grew into weeks and the combined efforts
of the police, the best detective agencies in the country,
and every other agency that money and determination
could press into the service, failed to find a shadow of a
trace, until at length other crimes and an epidemic of
disappearances among young Society girls distracted their
attention and I continued the search alone.</p>

<p>Hope dies hard; and there was always the chance
that the child might make her way home again, or that
I might hear of her or from her in some roundabout
way; for at least her body had not been found. But
after two months of utterly unsuccessful search, almost
continuous by day and night, I was pretty desperate
now, standing up there on the roof of the building in
New York in which I had taken an apartment.</p>

<p>Everything else had been dropped and I had moved
to New York. I had been in queer places and seen
queer sights during those eight weeks. I had pierced
the outer, commonplace integument of a great city—the
shifting scene of blank, reserved humanity that meets
the casual eye—and had been caught up and swept nearly
off my feet once or twice in the seething welter of passion
and crime that swells and ebbs beneath the city’s
impassive exterior.</p>

<p>But of the slip of a girl I sought and now almost
dreaded to find I could learn—nothing.</p>

<p>Stretching away below me as I watched, the city
crouched purring, like some great animal motionless and
watchful. I hated it actively for what it had done to me,
longing to tear out its secret by violence, if need be.
But after a while sanity slowly returned and the
momentary madness faded. I can only say in excuse that
the gnawing anxiety of those two months must have
somewhat undermined a pretty normal point of view.</p>

<p>But with returning sanity came a slow resolve. Up
to now I had been seeking blindly, with no plan—no
definite aim, no thought of the future. From now on
I vowed that my life should be given up to the search;
that nothing should interfere with it; that only death
or success should put an end to it. The resolve brought
me a curious sense of peace. That much I could
do—even though it were all I could do. But that much
should be done.</p>

<p>With the thought I turned away from the parapet
to go to my rooms below and try to lay out some sort
of a campaign for the future. As I turned a touch
fell upon my arm and I found Larry standing beside me.
In the dim light from the open doorway that led to the
roof I could detect the half-veiled pity in his eyes.</p>

<p>I had acquired Larry a couple of weeks before, or
rather had had him more or less thrust upon me, and
had not regretted it.</p>

<p>Early in the search I bought a small light car and
scoured the city night after night in it, in the hope of
catching a glimpse of Margaret. One night I had been
driving slowly along the Bowery. It was very late and
the long, wide, cobbled street under the L structure
was deserted. But as I came to a corner, Larry darted
out of a side street, yanked open the rear door of the car
and dropped into the obscurity of the tonneau behind
me, with “For God’s sake, d‑r‑r‑rive on, sor. It’s half
a dozen of them gangsters is after me!”</p>

<p>The sheer impudence of it took my breath away for
a moment, and with the sudden natural impulse of a
sporting chance for the hunted thing, I stood on the
accelerator and whisked around a corner and out of
sight before it came home to me that I was probably
defeating the ends of justice. Then, too, there had
been a quality of warmth and a hint of laughter in the
rich brogue of the speaker that appealed to me and
seemed to lift him out of the common run of
malefactors.</p>

<p>Once committed, however, I turned a lot more corners
and put a good bit of the city between us and his
pursuers before I pulled into the curb and turned to have
it out with my “fare.”</p>

<p>He forestalled me. He jumped to his feet at once.
“Do but wait now, sor, and lave me have a look at ye!”
said he.</p>

<p>Surprise and wrathful amazement kept me silent for
a moment while he stared into my face. Then just as
I was preparing to give him an extensive and
unvarnished account of what I thought of him and his
impudence, he slapped his thigh, and leaning forward
took my hand and touched the top of his head with it,
in a queer old-fashioned gesture.</p>

<p>“Faith, sor, I knew ut! You’re the man for me and
I’m your man from this day forth. See now, tell me
what it is you want in the world and I’ll get it ye. Ye
have the look of a seeker, sor. Tell me what it is ye
seek and I’ll find it. There now!”</p>

<p>I could not answer for a moment. The beggar was
so impudent and so amazingly penetrating. Then I
recovered my tongue and proceeded to give him a
dressing down that I’m proud of even now, when I think of
it. He listened without a word and with only an
occasional wriggle of the body to show that some comment of
mine upon his personal appearance had gone home. I
wound up with the observation that I now proposed to
take him and hand him over to the nearest policeman
with a full account of our meeting.</p>

<p>“That’s it, sor!” he broke in, as I finished, “you’re
the master for a lawless lad like me. I knew it from
the fir‑r‑rst. An’ ye’ll not be for givin’ me up to thim
cops at the latter end, afther the way ye’d made such
a rescue an’ all. Faith, ’twas a small matther av a
colleen av wan av thim gangsters, sor!”</p>

<p>He paused and looked at me with something of
anxiety in his eyes. “See now, give me up to thim thin if
ye must, sor. Thim bhoys is nothin’ an’ I’ll soon be
quit of the pack of thim again. But ye’ll not be the
sort that’s met with every day. An’—an’ I’d like fine
to serve ye, sor!”</p>

<p>To tell the truth, I was puzzled. The man had been
clever enough not to threaten me in return with the
disclosure of my part in his escape, supposing I were
to give him up. If he had, I should have handed him
over at once. And at his first appearance there had
been something of exultation mixed with his fear, so
that I doubted in him any great depth of depravity
for its own sake. Moreover, his first words about
seeker and search had been a wild stab in the dark
from an arrant braggart, but—they had struck home.
God knows, I needed help in my search, and what right
had I to refuse it, in however wild a guise it presented
itself? The fellow was young, with the slimness of
youth, but he was big-boned and powerful-looking and
his eyes were bright with intelligence. He might prove
a useful ally enough if he were sincere. For the moment
I could only temporize.</p>

<p>“What do you mean by ‘serve me’? Do you think
I want a chauffeur or what?” I demanded.</p>

<p>His answering look was full of reproach. At least
his face was frank and open for any man to read, the
emotions chasing each other across it like ripples of wind
on a mountain lake. There was something attractive,
too, about the youth and vitality and daring of his
make-up.</p>

<p>“Faith, that’s not yerself, sor. Did I not tell ye
there was the look of the seeker about ye? There’s
lines of pain an’ fear an’ anxious nights and days in
yer face, sor, an’ that’s God’s truth, beggin’ yer pardon,
sor. I saw that at once. An’ I’d like foine to hilp ye
to yer desire, the way we would be worrkin’ together on
it. <em>If</em> there’s a bit of excitement about it, so much the
better, sor. Have ye a ‘man’ already?”</p>

<p>“You know who I am, then,” I told him sharply;
“that is evident.”</p>

<p>“I do not, sor,” he answered, triumph in his voice.
“But I’m right then, sor?”</p>

<p>“Yes, you’re right,” I answered wearily. “Well—you’d
better come home with me now and we’ll talk over what’s
to be done with you.” I started the car again and so
drove home with him.</p>

<p>I put the car away and then took him up to my study,
set him down and fell to cross-examining him on his
past life, with a view to getting a better line on the
man himself from his way of answering. Some mix-up
over a colleen had sent him out of Ireland as a boy
and he had drifted to New York, that Mecca of the
Irish. He told me frankly that his father had argued
and occasionally beaten into him the conviction that
the world owed him a living and a good one. In New
York he had tried common labor, odd jobs and work
as a shipping clerk, but had found no good living at
any of them. So he had drifted into bad company and
a manner of life that promised an easy existence, plenty
of pickings, and above all, the excitement that his soul
craved. The pickings had not been all he had hoped,
it seemed. But there had certainly been plenty of
excitement.</p>

<p>“So,” I told him calmly, “I’m to take you on here
and install you, so that you can clean the place out in
my absence, without even the trouble of breaking in!”</p>

<p>The hurt, resentful look on his face was enough to
convince me. But he turned away and started for the
door, his cap in his hand. “Faith, sor,” he answered
quietly, “I took ye for a man of more—sinse, beggin’
yer pardon, sor. I’ll just be goin’, unless ye’d like to
give me up still?”</p>

<p>“Come back here and turn out your pockets.”</p>

<p>He came slowly back to the table, a glint in his eye
and rebellion latent in every line of him. I took a quick
step forward. “On the table,” I told him quietly.</p>

<p>It was a sorry collection. Bits of string, a heavy
clasp knife, a half-eaten sandwich, a letter or two from
the old country made up the total with a few small coins.</p>

<p>“Is that all?”</p>

<p>“That’s all.”</p>

<p>“All right, put them back. I’m glad we’ve nothing
to return to the rightful owners. Now come with me
and I’ll show you your room. The first thing you’d
better do is to take a bath.”</p>

<p>“By God, sor,” he said, and stopped, the blood
flooding his face. “Ye’ll—ye’ll not regret it!” he added
quietly, a moment later.</p>

<p>So I took him into my service, ostensibly as a valet,
a nuisance which I did not want in the least, but
actually for the aid his knowledge of the under-world might
prove in my search. But before a week had passed I had
learned to like the man for himself, for his cheery
optimism, his courage and his faithfulness, also somewhat
for his incurable laziness and bragging, though it would
never have done to let him know it; and I spent most of
our time together outlining the most unflattering views
on his ancestry and personal habits.</p>

<p>We had already pulled out of some pretty tight
corners together, but through it all he had stood by me,
plucky, optimistic, for ever bragging and for ever ready
for anything. To tell the truth he had pulled me back
to a sane frame of mind more than once with his
nonsense. But whether he knew this and did it on purpose
or not I could not tell.</p>

<p>Up on the roof now, he stood beside me for a moment
before he spoke.</p>

<p>“Well?” I demanded, sharply.</p>

<p>“There’s a gintleman to see ye, sor. Says his name
is Bertrand Moore, or some such thruck as that. He
gave me no cyard. I did tell him, sor, that ye would
not be wishful to be disturbed. But he was all for seein’
ye, whether or no. Sure he folleyed me up here a ways,
till I turned back to him. Shall I sind him about his
business?”</p>

<p>With this he lapsed into silence, waiting calmly for
directions. He was quite ready, as I knew, either to
throw the visitor out bodily or to make him at home,
whichever he was told. Aside from myself, matters of
ethics did not trouble Larry in the slightest, and it was
this quality in him that had brought back to me the
power to laugh.</p>

<p>“What does he want? Do you know?” I asked.</p>

<p>“That I don’t, sor. There’s a lackadaisical air about
him, an’ yet I’ve a notion he’s used to havin’ his way,
sor. He wud not tell me more than just that he wanted
to be seein’ ye, an’ see ye he wud!”</p>

<p>The name conveyed nothing to me, and it was not
until I entered my small drawing-room and my visitor
rose to his feet that I placed him. I had seen him once
or twice hanging round the police station when my search
had taken me there, and had also met him once at the
house of some friends. I had put him down as a bit of
a lounge lizard, his dress and manner of speech giving
me that impression rather than his face. So, after
shaking hands, I waited with some interest and secret
amusement to learn what he wanted with me.</p>

<p>“How do you do, Mr. Clayton?” he began in his
mincing voice. Then he glanced at Larry, who was
hovering about in the background. “May I
have—er—five minutes of your time—alone?”</p>

<p>“I suppose so,” I answered, smiling. “You can go,
Larry. Sit down Mr.—Moore, isn’t it?”</p>

<h2>Chapter II. <br> “The Shadow of the Web”</h2>

<p>My visitor nodded and sank gracefully into a
chair, leaning back negligently. But as soon
as the door had closed on Larry he seemed to
stiffen in a surprising manner, his negligence dropped
from him and he leaned forward with a certain eagerness.
There was a force about him now of which I had not been
conscious before.</p>

<p>“Mr. Clayton,” he began, “I want to talk to you
about your own affairs—and I can only hope that you
will hear me out before you resent the apparent
impertinence. I assure you that there is a reason—and a
good one—for my action. Have I your leave to go on?”</p>

<p>I nodded shortly. “Let’s hear what’s on your mind,”
I told him. “But I won’t guarantee not to resent any
impertinence, as you call it,” I added grimly.</p>

<p>He bowed and smiled. “That’s only natural and
to be expected,” he said. “But this is what I came to
talk to you about.” He paused a moment as though
to collect his ideas, and then continued quickly: “You
have, I believe, spent the last two months searching for
your sister. I believe that, to a certain extent, I can
help you in this search, or, rather, that I can put you
in the way of helping yourself—seeking at a greater
advantage and perhaps to better purpose. If you care
to listen to me, I will tell you what I have in mind. But
before doing so, I am forced to ask you for a pledge of
absolute secrecy. That is quite essential.”</p>

<p>He waited then, and I stared at him in growing
amazement. Of all the queer rigmarole——</p>

<p>He saw my expression and smiled. “Sounds like
something straight out of a melodrama, doesn’t it?”
he said. Then the smile left his face and he went on
soberly: “Nevertheless, I am very much in earnest. I
was never more serious in my life than I am now, in
assuring you that I believe I can help you and that the
pledge of secrecy is quite essential. You will see why
at once, if you give it. As you know nothing at all
about me, I might add that such a pledge will bind
you to nothing at all dishonorable, nor will it force
you to connive at anything dishonorable by your
silence.”</p>

<p>“Good Lord, man,” I broke out at this, “what kind
of a bee <em>have</em> you got in your bonnet? You seem to be
in earnest, but what’s all this talk about secrecy? If
you know anything about my sister, for God’s sake tell
it to me and have done. I’ve been disappointed so
often——”</p>

<p>He shook his head, his face sobering instantly. “I’m
sorry to say I haven’t,” he answered; “I’ve done my best,
too. But there, give the pledge, man. It’s little enough
to give and I know you’ll keep it.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” I said at last, “I’ll keep secret anything
you tell me, provided—well, you understand. I’ll give
you my word on that.”</p>

<p>He sat up, smiling again. “Good, I took you for a
man of sense and I was right. The suggestion I have
to make to you is, that if you allied yourself with a
certain organization, you would be in a better position
to pursue your search. The organization can help you
in many ways, and your search itself will be of help to
the others—the men affiliated with you.”</p>

<p>“And the organization?” I demanded.</p>

<p>“The organization is the Secret Service of the United
States!” he answered quietly.</p>

<p>I sat and stared at him at this. And the longer I
stared the more indignant I grew. The thing was
preposterous on the face of it. In the first place, what had
he to do with the detection of crime—this fastidious
young fop? Secondly, how could I pursue my own
search if I joined such an organization, presuming for
a moment that I could do so? And lastly, how could
my search be of any possible benefit to the United States?
Still he seemed sane enough. There was an earnestness
about him that bade me hesitate in my indignation even.
And he must have <em>some</em> object in his proposal.</p>

<p>At last the funny side of it struck me and I laughed.
“Well, one of us is crazy, I think, and I don’t think
it’s I. Now will you tell me what grounds you have
for making such a proposal—what possible use I would be
to the Secret Service—and how on earth it would help
me to join them?” I demanded.</p>

<p>He laughed in his turn. “I admit it sounds absurd,”
he said, “but I think I can answer your questions to
some extent. Under your pledge of secrecy I can at least
tell you that I have the honor to be an operative of the
Bureau of Investigation of the Department of Justice.
That is one of my reasons for making you this proposal.
Secondly, I am not alone in believing that you might be
of great service to us at this time, even,” he added,
smiling, “if you do give food, shelter and comfort, as we say,
to a young gangster!”</p>

<p>I nodded grimly. “Is there anything else that you
know about me?”</p>

<p>He laughed. “Yes, quite a lot. In fact, practically
everything. I know that you have considerable
independent means, that you are, or were, fairly successful as an
artist—portrait painter; that your parents are dead;
that you are an athlete; that in spite of prohibition you
still buy bonded gin and whisky occasionally, by the case,
and where you get it; that during your search for your
sister you narrowly escaped getting mixed up in that
Gerachty murder case; that you were in the room when
the man was stabbed, and that you got out by a clever
dodge of walking backward, so that when the police
entered they thought you were just coming in; that you
haven’t by any means given up the hope of finding your
sister, and that——” Here I held up my hand and he
stopped.</p>

<p>“You certainly have the advantage of me,” I told
him. “Now suppose you proceed and tell me why you
think the Department will help me in my search?”</p>

<p>He shook his head. “In spite of your pledge, I
cannot tell you that, unless and until you decide to join.
There is too much in the balance and I have pledges of
my own to consider.” He leaned forward and spoke
eagerly. “But listen. This is a <i>bona fide</i> offer and I am
empowered to make it. You are mixing yourself up,
or are trying to, in something far bigger than you have
any idea of—something far too big for you to handle
alone. Join us! You have got nowhere this way—that
I happen to know. Indeed, if you had, almost
certainly you would not be here to give me this interview.
That much I will tell you. Come with me to-morrow
and see the Chief and listen to what he has to say.
Perhaps he will make things clearer than I have the
right to. But you have nothing to lose and, I believe,
everything to gain by joining us. Our Chief is in town
for a few days. Will you come?”</p>

<p>I sat taking him in for a moment. “Well,” I answered
at last, “I don’t believe you’re crazy anyhow, though the
thing sounds absurd enough in all conscience. Moreover,
I hate to spare even one day from my search, just
because I have got nowhere, as you say. But I think I’ll
take a chance and see this chief of yours, whoever he
is.”</p>

<p>I broke off short because my visitor had got slowly
and silently to his feet and was tiptoeing toward the
window, where heavy curtains were drawn half-way back
to let in the evening air.</p>

<p>As he passed me, he nodded and motioned me to go
on talking, his lips forming the words “Go on!”</p>

<p>“What time do you want me to meet you and where?”
I went on at random.</p>

<p>My visitor reached the window and snatched one of
the heavy curtains aside. I caught a glimpse of a
startled face—saw the face twist into a sudden,
frightened snarl. Then Moore’s hand flashed to his hip as I
got to my feet. The room rang with the crash of a
revolver shot and I clapped my hand to the side of my
head. I saw the intruder stumble forward into the room
through the smoke, tearing with both hands at his chest,
and then sink limply to the floor. A small metal object
shaped something like a hammer-head dropped from his
hand as he fell.</p>

<p>Glass was still tinkling on the floor from a broken
picture behind me as my visitor slipped his revolver
back in his pocket and stooped over the fallen man.
“Good Lord, so soon?” I heard him whisper.</p>

<p>I stumbled over to him, speechless, as Larry came
running into the room, a ludicrous look of apprehension
on his face. It cleared a little when he saw me. Then
a moment later he caught sight of the blood on the side
of my face and came running over to me. “My God,
sor, did he get you bad? I’ll tear the heart out av him.”
He turned on Moore, and then for the first time caught
sight of the man on the floor. Moore turned to me at
the same moment.</p>

<p>“Did he get you? Not badly, did he?” He strode
over to me. “Let’s have a look! No, just a scratch,
thank goodness. Close call though.”</p>

<p>“Say, what the devil is it all about?” I began. “Who
is this fellow, and what the hell did he get me with? I’ll
swear there was only one revolver shot and that was
yours.”</p>

<p>But Moore interrupted me. “Listen,” he said quickly.
“That one is dead, I think, and a good job too. But
you and I are also, or as good as dead, if a word of this
gets into the papers. I want you to ’phone to police
headquarters, if your head will let you, and ask for
Captain Peters. Don’t talk to any one else on any
account. When you get him, give him this address and
tell him to come here at once. Give him no name, but tell
him he’s wanted. Better wash out that wound first,
though. Get rid of your man and keep his mouth shut,
will you? I’m going to search this fellow.”</p>

<p>Whatever it was that had struck me, the wound on
the side of my head was only a scratch. Larry,
seething with indignation and curiosity, washed it out for me,
keeping up a running fire of questions the while, to which
I returned no answer. My visitor’s manner, to say
nothing of my own narrow escape, had convinced me that
the matter was serious, and the less Larry knew the less
he could talk, though I doubted anything but his
discretion. A few moments later I went to the telephone,
leaving Larry in his room with orders to stay there and to
keep his mouth shut in future, and leaving Moore still
busy with his victim. My own head was seething with
remonstrance and questions, to say nothing of a slight
dizziness induced by the blow it had received. But I
succeeded in getting Captain Peters and delivering my
message. “I’ll be there in ten minutes, tell him!” came
over the wire to me, followed by the crash of the
receiver in its socket. Then I turned back to Moore and
the thing he was searching.</p>

<p>He looked up as I gave him the captain’s message.
“Thanks,” he said. Then, indicating the man on the
floor, “Nothing at all on him except—this! What do
you make of it? Be careful!”</p>

<p>I took the metal object that the intruder had dropped
as he fell. But I could make nothing of it. It
resembled nothing I had ever seen except that there was
a projection about an inch long from the middle of it
that might be a muzzle. It was made of blued steel
and built to fit in the hand when half closed, so that the
muzzle protruded between the second and third fingers.</p>

<p>“It’s some sort of an air revolver,” Moore explained;
“but I’ve never seen anything just like it before. Maybe
it’ll come in useful, though. Gad, I hope this fellow
was alone!” he added.</p>

<p>“But who is he?” I demanded at last, “and how on
earth did he get in here?”</p>

<p>“As to who he is,” Moore smiled, a little grimly,
“you’ll find out all about that to-morrow—if he was
alone. Otherwise you probably won’t live that long.
As to how he got in: like a fool I misunderstood your
man and followed him a little way toward the roof
when he first started after you. He had left the door
of the apartment open and this poor devil must have
slipped in then. Your man turned back and showed
me in here, but I suppose he must have hidden behind
the curtain at once. The time was so short that I
never thought to suspect anything or look for
eavesdroppers, until I saw the curtain bulge a little in a way
no summer breeze would move it. You saw the rest,
and I’ll say it was a damned close thing at that, that he
didn’t get the two of us. But come on, let’s get him
out of this.”</p>

<p>Together we carried the man to a chair and sat him
up in it. I put my ear to his chest, but the burnt hole
in his coat and in the shirt beneath, through which bright
red blood was still slowly oozing, was directly over the
heart. The man was stone dead.</p>

<p>Moore stood looking down at him a moment. “Poor
devil,” he said. “He was only a tool, <em>but</em>, none the
less, I think he was here to finish my little business, and
yours too, probably, after what I had told you.” He
hesitated. “What’s more,” he went on, “it’s probably a
good job for both of us that he’s dead. The only good
Indian is a dead Indian, and this fellow is one of that
breed.”</p>

<p>At this moment the bell rang and I went to the door.
Coming just after the recent scene I had witnessed, the
burly police captain who stood there gave me a twinge
of uneasiness on Moore’s account, for I had taken a
strong liking to my unconventional and quick-witted
visitor. But the captain only nodded and passed in
front of me through the hall, as I stood back, entering
the room where Moore still hung over his victim, as
though to wring the last bit of information out of him.</p>

<p>Moore nodded and spoke at once. “Captain Peters,
I’m sorry to say I’ve killed this man. I caught him
behind that curtain, and it was a close thing at that,
as you can see by that picture over there and by this
gentleman’s head.”</p>

<p>The police captain whistled and, striding over to
the body, stared down at it for a moment. Then he
turned back to Moore. “I don’t know him, do you?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“No,” the other answered, “I don’t. I don’t believe
I’ve ever seen him before. But I want you to get a taxi
and get him out of here at once, if you will. You can
find him somewhere else; anywhere, you know. But
keep the thing entirely out of the papers if you can, in
any case. That’s important, as you can guess. Above
all, captain, don’t let it get about that he had anything
to do with me or with this gentleman or that he was killed
in this building. If you do, my life will be a poor risk for
any insurance company, though I guess it’s that already.
You know enough about this business to know that!
Will you fix it for me?”</p>

<p>“I’ll fix it,” the captain answered, laconically. He
turned in my direction, “Who’s this?” he asked
curiously.</p>

<p>“Meet Mr. Clayton, Captain Peters,” Moore answered,
with a shadow of a wink at me for the style of
introduction. “He’s not with us yet, but I believe he will
be before long,” he added.</p>

<p>“Good enough!” said the captain and shook hands,
his manner thawing considerably. “Glad to meet you,
Mr. Clayton. Well, if you’ll ’phone for the taxi, I
guess I can manage to get this downstairs by myself.
I guess it will be better if neither of you gentlemen
show yourselves.”</p>

<p>A few moments later the taxi arrived, and after
putting a fresh coat on the body—one of Larry’s, by the
way—and closing the eyes, we rang for the elevator.
When the boy finally woke up and arrived at our floor,
I had an opportunity to observe something of the
quality that had brought the captain his rank. He marched
into the elevator with his arm around the body,
supporting it. He set it down on the seat and sat down
beside it, and as the elevator door closed on the round,
startled eyes of the operator, I heard the captain gruffly
admonishing his charge, in the usual tone: “Come on
now, you ain’t as drunk as all that.”</p>

<p>As soon as I rejoined Moore, he turned away from
the window where he had been standing and, walking
up to me, held out his hand.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry—damned sorry—that this happened here,
Clayton. Of course I’m sorry that it happened at all,
except that it’s one less to reckon with, and of course
that bump on the head you got is at my door. But what
you’ve seen to-night is a little—just a very little shadow
of what you’re up against—if you only knew it. Now I
must go. Be at 7th Avenue and 16th Street to-morrow
at 3.30. There’s no need to mix you up with this yet until
you make up your mind. And it will be best, I think,
if we’re not seen together. Will you do it?”</p>

<p>“I’ll be there,” I told him.</p>

<p>“Right,” he answered. “Good-night. Don’t come out
to the elevator with me. I’m going to walk down a few
flights anyway,” and with a smile and a graceful wave
of the hand that brought back his original simpering
manner, he let himself out and was gone.</p>

<p>I called Larry at last and set him, sullen and
rebellious, to picking up the pieces of the broken picture
glass and to washing away the blood-stains on the floor.
Then I sat down to ponder upon the events of the night
and the new features they had introduced into my search.</p>

</div>

<hr class="x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter" id="ch03">

<h2>Chapter III. <br> “That’s All We Know”</h2>

<p>Next morning I had to deal with a suspicious
and indignant Larry, with smoldering rebellion
in every line of him. Nothing would convince
him that the shot that broke the picture was not intended
for me. In fact, I found him, just after breakfast,
polishing up the revolver of his lawless days and whistling softly
the while. I felt pretty certain that another such
unconventional visitor as the man who had died at my feet
would get a warm reception in my absence.</p>

<p>Larry had a grievance that morning; in fact, two of
them. In the first place I told him that I was going to
meet Moore, but had not told him why, nor what I was
going to do. This was grievance number one, for up to
now he had shared my plans.</p>

<p>But far greater than this was his grievance over the
amazing metamorphosis of the graceful and negligent
Moore. The glimpse Larry had caught of him, standing,
smoking revolver in hand, over the dead man, had upset
Larry’s calculations completely. He seemed to take it
rather as a personal affront that this gentle soul should
turn into a killer like that, behind his back. Perhaps
the way Moore had ordered him out of the room
afterwards had something to do with it.</p>

<p>However, I left him in charge of everything, and
even commissioned him to wander about the city where
his fancy led, to see whether he could pick up any clews.
From a study of portraits and photographs, he had
long since impressed my sister’s face on his memory,
and he knew by heart the details of the dress she wore
that day. This and his post in command of the fort,
as it were, cheered him up a bit. I left him finally
resigned and whistling over his revolver.</p>

<p>Personally, I felt considerably more cheerful that
morning than I had felt for a long time. In the strain and
fatigue of endless search, questing here, there, and
wherever impulse led, I had had no time to brood over
the fact that I was doing it alone. I had been in some
pretty tight corners in my search, where, I believe now,
only fixity of purpose had pulled me through.</p>

<p>I had not realized this at the time. But I am
naturally rather of a peaceful disposition; I had my fill
of fighting with the Lafayette Esquadrille during the war
and had no desire for further excitement. So the new
sense I had this morning of companionship,
encouragement and backing waiting for me ahead put new heart
into me. I felt somehow that things had taken a turn
for the better in my quest. And I was filled with an even
greater determination to see the thing through, however
long it took and whatever happened. But for all this,
I think it was as well that I could not see what lay ahead
for me in the weeks to come.</p>

<p>I could find no one to meet me when I reached the
rendezvous which Moore had designated. As I paused
irresolute at the curb edge, a workman, lounging against
a lamp-post and sucking on a dry cutty pipe, leisurely
uncrossed his legs and sauntered up to me.</p>

<p>“Say, Mister, got a match on ye?” said he.</p>

<p>I handed him my box rather absently. But as he
struck a match and stooped to light his pipe, he moved
a little closer to me as though to shelter the flame. “Your
cab’s across the way, sir,” he whispered. “At the corner,
there. The driver knows.”</p>

<p>A moment later he straightened up and flipped away
the match. “Much obliged, Mister,” he said. Then he
handed me the box of matches and sauntered back to his
lamp-post.</p>

<p>I moved across the street without looking at the man
again. What I had seen of Moore and the man who
had followed him the night before gave me no reason
to believe that he and his associates would go in for a
needless display of melodramatic secrecy. Therefore,
if my arrival and destination seemed to them best kept
secret, it was up to me to take the hint and fall in with
their plans.</p>

<p>The car across the street was an ordinary taxi. As
I came up to him the driver called, “Taxi, sir?” and
reached back to open the door, quite in the natural
manner.</p>

<p>“You know where to go?” I asked him.</p>

<p>He nodded. “Right you are, sir. Jump in!” he said,
as though I had given him an address. A moment later
we were speeding away. My new life and associations
had begun.</p>

<p>Once started, I fell to wondering again as to why I
had been sent for and how I could serve the ends of the
Department, for of course the Department must have
some definite object in view. I pictured the interview,
imagining myself in some spick and span Municipal Office
temporarily placed at the disposal of this distinguished
visitor from Washington, chatting with some elderly
gentleman of a curt and somewhat pompous mien. I was
never more mistaken in my life!</p>

<p>We drove for ten or fifteen minutes, in and out among
the little streets of Greenwich Village. Then suddenly
the taxi pulled up in front of a little hotel below
Washington Square, of which I had never even heard.</p>

<p>As I got out, the man glanced at the meter and raised
his flag. “It’s sixty cents, sir,” he said casually.</p>

<p>Somewhat at a loss, I handed him a dollar bill. At
that he dived into his pocket, picked out a dollar in
change and presented it to me with a grin. He leaned
forward as he did so. “Room 333, sir,” he said softly.
Then, raising his voice: “All right, sir, I’ll be here at
ten!”</p>

<p>A moment later he and his taxi had disappeared.</p>

<p>I entered the hotel, walked through the lobby, nodded
to the elevator-boy and told him the third floor. And
presently I was knocking at the door of Room 333.</p>

<p>It flew open and disclosed Moore, as immaculate as
ever, but with an anxious look on his face which
disappeared when he saw me. He reached out and pulled me
into the room, shutting and locking the door again
without wasting an instant.</p>

<p>“Thank goodness you got here all right. I was getting
nervous. Now let me introduce you to the Chief.”</p>

<p>Instead of the pompous individual I had expected to
meet, I found myself shaking hands with a big, genial
fellow, with a jaw like the prow of a ship and a warm
twinkle in his keen blue eyes. I took a liking to him at
once.</p>

<p>“Well, sir,” he said, “glad to meet you—and glad
you got here all serene. Mr. Clayton, isn’t it? Now
let’s get to business.”</p>

<p>The room was an ordinary hotel bedroom and small
at that. The Chief waved Moore and myself to seats on
the bed and sat himself down somewhat cautiously in
the only chair, which groaned under his bulk. He was
still smiling, but his eyes were keen and cold, and I
realized that the smile was purely automatic. He leaned
forward in the groaning chair and made his points, as
he talked, by tapping the forefinger of one hand in the
palm of the other.</p>

<p>“Now, Mister Clayton,” he said, “Moore here
suggested that you might be of use to us and I told him to
bring you along, so that we could talk it over. You see,
I am being frank with you, because I don’t suppose you
imagined for a minute that this was a philanthropic
proposition, eh?”</p>

<p>“No,” I told him bluntly, “neither on your side nor
on mine.”</p>

<p>He laughed. “Well, we’ll call it a mutual benefit
association. Anyhow, I know something about your
search for the last two months and about you yourself,
and your record in the war. Of course our men have
had Miss Clayton on their minds. But that’s not entirely
because of the dust you kicked up. There’s a bigger
reason, too.”</p>

<p>“Bigger because it’s pretty nearly national,” Moore
interjected softly.</p>

<p>The Chief nodded. “Yes, I might have put that
differently. But my work comes first, you understand.”</p>

<p>“How do you think I can help you and help myself
at the same time?” I asked him.</p>

<p>“I’m coming to that.” He broke off for a moment
and glanced about the tiny green and brown bedroom.
The glaring electrics in the central chandelier showed
up every line of the grim, resourceful face with the
grizzled hair above and the firm, heavy jaw. It was a
face to inspire confidence certainly—if you happened
to be on the same side with it. Otherwise it was
distinctly a face to avoid.</p>

<p>“The fact is, Clayton,” he said suddenly, “that the
Department is up against about the biggest thing in its
history. German spies were pretty nearly as easy as
picking cherries compared to this. And unless I’m very
much mistaken, you’re up against exactly the same
proposition. There’s the thing in a nutshell.”</p>

<p>“You mean——”</p>

<p>“I mean that if we can’t get anywhere with it—and
we haven’t got far, I’ll admit—why your chances are
pretty slim, working on your own. What’s more, if
you should stumble on to something, the chances are one
million to one that you’ll just get your throat cut for
your pains. On the other hand, if you work for us—that
is, if we work together on the proposition—why,
perhaps we can help you in your search with our
organization. And I believe you may be able to help <em>us</em>, or I
wouldn’t have sent for you.”</p>

<p>“But what <em>is</em> this thing I’m—you’re up against?” I
demanded.</p>

<p>The Chief scratched his head at this. “That’s just it.
We don’t know—anything definite. However, I’ll tell
you all there is to tell, and then you can make up your
mind whether you’ll accept or not. I think Moore here
told you that I’d like to have you working for me as
an unofficial and fairly independent operative?”</p>

<p>“He was damned uncommunicative on the subject,”
I answered.</p>

<p>Both the others laughed. “We don’t shout about our
business from the housetops much,” said the Chief. “But
this is a little of what we know. First of all, statistics.
During the last six months no less than thirty girls have
disappeared from the best families in and around New
York—and not one of them has been traced.”</p>

<p>“Thirty-four, with the Schyller case,” said Moore
softly.</p>

<p>“Exactly,” nodded the Chief. “Now, of course, girls
are disappearing all the time, running away to go on the
stage, eloping with the chauffeur, and so on. But very
few of these are from the older, quieter families—the
best families in the real sense. But the girls I’m talking
about, of whom your sister was one, are practically <em>all</em>
from the best families, all very young and all very
prepossessing.”</p>

<p>The Chief broke off and ran his blunt fingers through
his hair. “And, believe me, the pressure that’s been
brought to bear on us to find them has turned my hair
gray. But—we—haven’t—found—one!”</p>

<p>“Good God!” I began, but the Chief held up a
warning finger and glanced at the door. I went on more
quietly: “Do you mean to say it’s some sort of a gigantic
gang of—of——” I couldn’t finish.</p>

<p>“White slavers? No-o, I don’t think so,” he answered.
“Though I tell you, we don’t know.”</p>

<p>He paused at this and sat thinking for so long that
impatience got the better of me, and I urged him to go
on and tell me what they did know.</p>

<p>“Well, here’s the situation,” he said at last. “These
girls have disappeared in New York, in Atlantic City,
in Jersey towns and in Long Island, and two of them
in Philadelphia. But most of them in New York. They
have disappeared while shopping, while calling, while
going to or coming from the theater, some of them on
their way to hotels, and so on. Moreover, from what
we can gather, it looks as if they actually were engaged
in these innocent pursuits. I mean, these were not
ostensible occupations to cloak escapades or elopements.</p>

<p>“Therefore the evidence points overwhelmingly to
the fact that the disappearances were unwilling ones.
So far as we can tell, none of the girls, or very few of
them, were engaged in love affairs of a serious nature.
So much for that.”</p>

<p>Suddenly the Chief made a wry face and the stubbly
fingers ran through his hair rapidly two or three times.
“As we <em>haven’t</em> been able to find out anything definite,
we have had to fall back on deduction, which hasn’t
taken us far. But perhaps we <em>have</em> learned something
from it.</p>

<p>“You see, none of these girls were much in the public
eye. At the time they disappeared, they were on the
most ordinary and quietest of errands. But, in the vast
majority of cases, the errands were planned at least two
days in advance. That’s all we know.</p>

<p>“Perhaps that doesn’t tell us much and perhaps it
does. It is possible, of course, that they were drugged in
some way, by people on the watch in public places.
I mean without regard to their identity. On the other
hand, it <em>looks</em> as if most of the abductions must have
been planned in advance, <em>with a foreknowledge</em> of the
<em>girls’ movements</em>.</p>

<p>“You know as well as I do, that it isn’t so simple
to drug and kidnap a person in broad daylight, or, at
least, in a public place. These were not the type of
girls to be easily drawn into a more secluded place with
strangers, whether male or female, even if the girls were
alone. Do you see what I mean?”</p>

<p>“You mean spies in their homes? Servants?” I began.</p>

<p>The Chief shook his head. “Not likely. Servants
aren’t so well informed as all that, as a rule. No, the
conclusion that’s just forced itself on me is that, unlikely
as it may seem, the person or persons mixed up in this
business belong to the same class of Society as the girls
themselves.”</p>

<p>“But, good Lord, man—what—why——”</p>

<p>The Chief leaned forward suddenly, his jaw setting
into flinty lines. “For example, what do you know about
this Mrs. Furneau, who took your sister out to tea that
day?”</p>

<p>I sat back and stared at him, my mind racing back
to the night of Margaret’s disappearance. For an
instant it fastened on the vague sense of resentment I had
felt toward Mrs. Furneau for her part in the business.
Then common sense prevailed.</p>

<p>“But what on earth could she have had to do with
it? You don’t suppose she followed the child into the
store? And how could she abduct her if she had? That
was the most public of places,” I answered.</p>

<p>“Exactly,” said the Chief slowly; “if she ever went
to the store at all!”</p>

<p>“But—but——”</p>

<p>“Did any one in the store actually see her? Did
they remember and describe her?”</p>

<p>I shook my head. “But that doesn’t prove anything.”</p>

<p>“No, it doesn’t. I’m not trying to prove anything now.
I’m trying to show you our line of deduction. But what
<em>do</em> you know about the woman?”</p>

<p>“Very little. She was an acquaintance only. But
many of her friends are above suspicion.”</p>

<p>“And the people where she took your sister?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know so much about them.” I stared at him
in growing amazement. “But what could they have to
do with it? You don’t mean to say that you think——”</p>

<p>“I don’t think anything. I’m asking questions. What
did Mrs. Furneau’s chauffeur have to tell you?”</p>

<p>“Nothing more than she had to tell. He just
corroborated the fact that Margaret had gone into the store.”</p>

<p>“H’m,” said the Chief. “But of course that doesn’t
help much, one way or the other.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to say you think it’s possible that
Mrs. Furneau took the child to some house where she was
kept a prisoner? And Mrs. Furneau invented all that
business about the store? And her chauffeur was in it
too?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said the Chief. “But it’s a possible
line of investigation, isn’t it? And it’s one that you
haven’t touched? Now do you see where the
Department might be of some help to you in your search?”</p>

<p>“But Mrs. Furneau—why, the Morrisons know her
quite well. The thing’s out of the question.”</p>

<p>The Chief smiled slowly. “That’s the trouble with
you amateurs. You go into an investigation like this
with preconceived ideas—and all you look for is clews
that fit in with those ideas. We suspect everybody until
we can prove that they’ve had nothing to do with the
affair. Do you see the difference?”</p>

<p>I nodded. “Well, I’ll try it.”</p>

<p>“Now here’s something else,” he went on. “We’ve
come to the conclusion that, without a previous fairly
intimate knowledge of the future movements of some
of these girls, the abductions would have been
impossible. We also deduce that they would have been
very difficult, if not impossible, without actual
acquaintanceship, in several cases at least. That places the
gang, for I think it must be a gang, within certain high
social limits.</p>

<p>“But during the time that these girls have been
disappearing, there have also been a great many cases of
addiction to drugs coming to light—and all these cases,
without exception, have been highly placed socially. In
fact, the Department began investigating the drug cases
long before the abductions began. Many of the drug
addicts are women. All the ones to whom I have reference
are addicts of a peculiar kind. But almost without
exception these addicts are men and women of importance
and influence, either through position or wealth.”</p>

<p>“Can you connect them in any way with the
abductions?” I asked.</p>

<p>“No. Not definitely. In fact, not at all, except by
inference through the facts peculiar to both. But the very
fact that we cannot get anything on any of these people,
either the people who supply these drugs or the
abductors, goes to prove that there is an extraordinary power
and skill in organization behind each gang. Therefore,
by inference, it may be the same organizer or group
of organizers behind both. But, so far, we have not been
able to connect the two things further than that, even
by inference.”</p>

<p>Moore stirred in his place on the bed beside me and
the Chief glanced up at him.</p>

<p>“There’s one other feature to it, sir,” he said. “I’ve
been working on the abductions and nothing else. But
they had a damned good try at picking me off. Clarke
worked on the drug smuggling only—and——”</p>

<p>The Chief nodded. “Neither the one gang—nor the
other, if there are two gangs, will hesitate at murder,”
he said quietly.</p>

<p>“Good Lord, do you mean to say in this day and
age——”</p>

<p>“This day and age is just about the same as any other
day and age—because human nature doesn’t vary much,”
he interrupted. “We were just about due for something
new and startling in the criminal line, after this war,
and it looks as if we’ve got it. I’ll tell you something
more: we’ve had three highly trusted men on this
job—two on the drugs, and Moore here, on the abductions.
Moore has one or two leads started, though nothing very
definite—and they tried to get him that night in your
rooms. Of the other two operatives, one hasn’t been able
to find out a thing—not a damned thing—and he’s a good
man too. The other—this man Clarke, that Moore was
talking about—has—disappeared.”</p>

<p>“But haven’t you traced him?”</p>

<p>“Traced him, nothing. He’s simply vanished into
thin air. And, believe me, it’s no cinch for one of our
men to disappear without our tracing him pretty quick.
No, this gang is no slouch, I’ll say that for it.”</p>

<p>As I learned later on, a descent into slang was a sign
of considerable feeling on the part of the Chief. But at
this time his attitude struck me as a little unfeeling.</p>

<p>“Well,” I said, “it looks to me as if you were up
against something pretty difficult. But do you mean
that I can really be of some assistance to you in the
business?”</p>

<p>“That’s it exactly. For this type of work, with this
type of people, don’t you see that we’ve got to have
operatives who have the social entry if we’re to get
anywhere? Moore’s all right. But he can’t do it all alone.
And besides, he won’t last long alone, probably, as you
saw for yourself. Now if you join us in this work, you’ll
be looking for your sister with the whole power of the
Department back of you. But we want you to find her
<em>and bust up the gang</em>, as much as you do yourself. There’s
the situation. You’re fitted for the work, you’re vitally
interested, and we can help each other. Afterwards,
we’ll release you as soon as you like, if——” He left the
sentence unfinished.</p>

<p>“If there’s anything left to release,” I added dryly.</p>

<p>“You’ve hit it exactly,” he smiled.</p>

<p>It did not take me long to make up my mind. I had
nothing to lose and possibly everything to gain by
joining the Department, if they were willing for me to
continue my search in my own way. And working with the
consciousness of a powerful organization back of me was
infinitely preferable to doing it alone. I had expected that
they might want me to work entirely under their direction,
possibly in remote parts of the country. But the next
words of the Chief set my mind at rest on that point.</p>

<p>“We want you to stay in New York and take up your
life just where you left it off to-day. We want you to
get back into Society and become a regular lounge lizard
if necessary. And we want you to let the Department
help you with hints when it can. But for the rest, you
and Moore are to work together. It will be safer and
better for both of you. Will you do it?”</p>

<p>“I’ll do it,” I told him.</p>

<p>The Chief got to his feet and held out a massive hand.
“Right,” he said, “I’m mighty glad. And I think you’ve
made a wise decision. Now I’ve got a lot of work to do.
Moore has full instructions for you both. Anything else
you want to know he can tell you. Wait here for ten
minutes. Good-by and good luck!” With that he went
to the door. Then he suddenly turned back to me again:
“And by the way, Clayton!”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” I answered, smiling.</p>

<p>“Don’t talk about this business to anybody—<em>anybody</em>.
Is that clear with you?”</p>

<p>“Quite clear,” I assured him.</p>

<p>“You’ll meet some of the other operatives perhaps.
You’re almost sure to. But unless they come to you
with the proper credentials for this job, which Moore
will explain to you, don’t tell them things. There’s a
reason.”</p>

<p>Moore interrupted. “Don’t you think, Chief, that we
might tell him the reason?”</p>

<p>The Chief frowned. Then suddenly he made a wry
face again. “All right, I suppose so. The fact of the
matter is, Clayton, that for the first time in its history
either we’ve had the rottenest of bad luck, or—there’s a
leak somewhere in the Department. Now you
understand.”</p>

<p>Without another word he strode to the door again
and went out.</p>

<p>I turned to Moore and found him smiling whimsically.</p>

<p>“Nothing slow about your Chief,” I remarked.</p>

<p>He laughed. “Not so’s you could notice it!” Then
he held out his hand. “Well,” he said, “I think you’re the
sort of fellow I’d like to have with me in a real row. This
is going to be a real row. Don’t make any mistake about
that. But I believe we’re going to pull it off, eh?”</p>

<p>“I’ll give you mine on that,” I told him, and we shook
hands.</p>

<h2>Chapter IV. <br> Roving Commissions</h2>

<p>After the Chief left, Moore gave me my
instructions for that night. We were to leave the room
separately. I was to get into the same taxi which
I would find waiting and I was to pick up Moore at the
corner of Waverley Place and Fifth Avenue.</p>

<p>I followed instructions, found the taxi waiting and told
the man to drive to Washington Square. Five minutes
later my driver stopped without being told and Moore
jumped in beside me. The driver started off uptown at
once.</p>

<p>Moore turned to me with a smile. “Well, I guess
you’ll do. You caught the idea like a shot. Now let’s get
to business, for we’ve got one heluva lot to talk about.”</p>

<p>“Fire ahead.”</p>

<p>“One of the first things I am to impress on you is the
fact that from now on both our lives may depend upon
eternal vigilance. A single false step, a single unguarded
word or glance may easily mean—finish—for us. Stow
that away in your brain and don’t forget it. Take it
out and look at it every five minutes if you can.” He
paused a moment. “I’m not fussy myself, Clayton. I’ve
gone into this game for my own reasons. But this is
the meanest-looking job I’ve ever tackled, and that’s the
truth. And I don’t want to get bumped off before we’ve
put the job through.”</p>

<p>“I’ll remember,” I told him, “and I’m just as eager
to put it through as you are.”</p>

<p>“I know,” he answered. “Well, I want to tell you
something about the plan for you and me, so far as we’ve
mapped it out. The Chief told you his theory—that these
abductions and the smuggled drugs are the work of the
same gang. And he told you his reasons for believing
that the gang is highly placed, or has members highly
placed, socially.”</p>

<p>I nodded.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s where you and I come in. He wants
us to work together. And he wants us to be regular
lounge lizards, worming our way into all sorts of social
circles, fast, slow and medium. His idea is that sooner
or later we’ll run across something in the nature of a
clew. And when that happens we’re to follow it up like
grim death.”</p>

<p>“Seems pretty vague stuff to work on,” I observed.</p>

<p>“It is and it isn’t. As far as the girls are concerned,
we haven’t anything very definite to go on until after
the event—and then it’s too late, for they will have
covered up their tracks, in their skillful way. But it’s
different with the drug business. For there there ought to be
something to work on, if we’re smart enough to see it.
And if the Chief is right about it being the same gang,
why that helps us with the other affair, do you see!”</p>

<p>“If he <em>is</em> right!” I said.</p>

<p>“Well, I think he is. Anyhow it seems reasonable
and it’s about all we have got. But here’s another
thing. We had a talk yesterday before you turned up,
and the Chief agreed with me that it might be better for
us not to know each other. I mean, of course, we may
meet casually, but it’s highly probable that they have
their suspicions about me as it is, and it’s no use
dragging you down with me. For if we’re pretty thick, they’ll
suspect you too if they suspect me. That business in
your rooms that night looked bad, for I haven’t any other
enemies that I can think of.”</p>

<p>“But look here,” I told him, “we’ll have to work
together to some extent—compare notes and all that—and
besides, I’m quite ready to stand in with you on the risk
and that sort of thing.”</p>

<p>Moore shook his head and smiled. “Spoken like a
pal,” he said. “But this is a business proposition,
Clayton, and a tough one. And if we don’t work together,
why that leaves you all the freer to step in and haul me
out, if I get in a tight corner, don’t you see?”</p>

<p>I didn’t like it very much, but there was no point
in arguing about it just then. He knew more about
the game than I did, anyway. And I found out very
soon how wise his decision had been.</p>

<p>“Then,” he went on, “although we’re not connected
in any way in the public eye, we’ve got to fix up some
method of getting in touch with each other at any time,
on the instant and privately. Now this is what I doped
out to that end. I thought I’d take a room or rooms
somewhere near you. Perhaps I might take one in the same
building, anyway in the same block, so that we had no
street between. Then, with the aid of that young
Irishman of yours, we ought to be able to lay a private wire
between your room and mine. What do you think of
it?”</p>

<p>I laughed at the reference to Larry. “Sounds all right
to me,” I answered, “if you can get the room. They’re
pretty hard to find nowadays. But that building I’m in
seems to have quite a number of bachelor apartments. I
don’t see that your being in the same building would
connect us any, unless we blew into each other’s rooms when
some one was watching. That private wire sounds good,
but I don’t see how we’re going to lay it where it won’t be
seen, or without being seen doing it.”</p>

<p>“Do it at night. That’s easy enough. But we will
have to dope out some way so that it won’t be found,
except on the wildest of bad luck. Of course they’re
always making repairs and putting in telephones in those
apartment houses, and we’ll have to watch out for that.”</p>

<p>“Did the Chief mention any particular sets in New
York that he wanted us to go for? There are so many
thousands of cliques and social groups that we might
wander around for years without striking the right one.
And then we might not know it for the right one if we
saw it.”</p>

<p>“No. He left it pretty much up to us. But he did
suggest leaning toward the faster semi-Bohemian sets as
being more likely to indulge in drugs.”</p>

<p>Moore paused a moment. “Anyhow, Clayton, that’s
the gist of it. Work all your introductions for all you’re
worth. I thought at first that it might be well for you
to change your name and begin all over again, on account
of the gang knowing that you had lost your sister, and
therefore suspecting you of being still on their trail. But
that would mean giving up all your introductions and
losing a lot of time, and also the possibility of running
into people that you’d known before, which would make
complications. So the Chief decided that it would be
better to run the risk of their suspicion, because your
principal value in the search is your actual and potential
social <i>entrée</i>.”</p>

<p>“Did he map out any particular attitude he wanted
me to take—sort of character line?”</p>

<p>“No. But he thought you might let it escape you
that you had given up all hope of finding your sister,
and that you were broken by it and letting yourself
go to the dogs as the easiest way out. That would
serve your ends both ways. For taking to drugs would
be the most natural thing in the world for a man in
your position, and before you could do that, you would
have to get hold of the drugs. So that gives you a line
to work on.”</p>

<p>“Pretty smart of the Chief, I think.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s no slouch. Now I’m going to bed. But
before I go, take this.” He drew from his pocket a
tiny golden panther strung on a black cord. “Wear it
where you can get at it, but where no one else would
see it or could pick your pocket for it. And if any one
shows you one like it, trust him. It’s the symbol for
this particular job. I won’t see you in the morning at
all. But to-morrow night suppose you meet me upstairs
in a little chop-suey joint in Broadway at 39th Street.
The tables are screened off and no one will notice us. We
can talk there in peace and quiet and make some more
definite plans for keeping in touch with each other. In
the meantime try to get started on the social stuff. Dig
up all your old friends and start things going. Maybe
that Mrs. Furneau might be a good one to start on. After
all you don’t know much about her.”</p>

<p>Moore got up. “Well, meet me at that chop-suey joint,
remember. Broadway at 39th at eight, and we’ll have
another powwow. In the meantime, good luck!”</p>

<p>He gave me a quick handshake, rapped on the window
of the cab and as the vehicle slowed up, flung open the
door and slipped out. A moment later he had disappeared
among the shifting pedestrians on the Avenue.</p>

<hr>

<p>When I got back I found that Larry was disposed to
consider his feelings hurt. The affliction took the form
of an attitude of exaggerated servitude which was
irritating in the extreme. He wanted as much disciplining as
a puppy.</p>

<p>However, something occurred almost at once that
brought him out of it with a bump.</p>

<p>I asked him whether anything had happened in my
absence.</p>

<p>“No, sir,” he answered in the true butler manner.
“Nothing of any moment, sir.” His English was
excellent when he wanted to make it so.</p>

<p>“What do you mean—nothing of any moment?” I
demanded curiously.</p>

<p>“Why, nothing, sir, nothing happened at all.” He
bowed deferentially. “Have you breakfasted, sir?”</p>

<p>I felt like kicking him. “Drop it, Larry,” I told
him. “I don’t know what’s biting you and I haven’t the
time to bother to find out. But if you take my advice,
you’ll drop that butler business, you ignoramus. Now
get out of it.”</p>

<p>Larry departed and I went to my desk to look up
the address of some of my one-time friends and to
drop a line to Mrs. Furneau. A moment later I rang
for Larry.</p>

<p>“How many times have I told you to leave my desk
alone?” I demanded.</p>

<p>Larry scratched his head. “Sure, times and thin
times,” he answered. “But faith, I haven’t so much
as laid a finger on it.”</p>

<p>“Don’t talk nonsense. I left these papers under that
folded map of New York. Now the papers are all mixed
up and the paper-weight is on them. I found the map
over here—and, by golly, you’ve even unfolded it and
folded it up again the wrong way. What do you mean
by it?”</p>

<p>Larry’s butler manner dropped from him now like
a garment. “Faith, thin, sor, I haven’t so much as
touched the desk, that I haven’t!” he declared earnestly.
“Maybe you forgot, like, the way you left things.”</p>

<p>I shook my head and stood staring at him a moment.
“Are you sure?” I demanded.</p>

<p>“Sure and sartin, sor. I haven’t touched it.”</p>

<p>“Well then, Larry, somebody else has!” I told him.
“I thought you said nothing had happened. Who’s been
here, anyway?”</p>

<p>“Not a soul, sor,” he answered quickly.</p>

<p>“Have you been here all the time yourself?” I
demanded.</p>

<p>“Ivery minute, sor, except for a walk round
yesterday afternoon and a trip to the corner last night, to
lay in a bit of bread and meat like.”</p>

<p>I had never known Larry to lie about anything at all
serious, and he was obviously speaking the truth this time.
“All right, never mind, Larry. No harm done,” I told
him. And again Larry took himself off, thoroughly
crestfallen now.</p>

<p>But I stowed away another bit of news for Moore
that night. For I was certain that my papers had been
tampered with in my absence, although, fortunately,
they were merely personal letters and bills.</p>

<p>I wrote to Mrs. Furneau, asking her whether she had
heard anything at all in the way of possible clews, and
whether I might call and talk things over with her
once more, adding that I had practically given up hope.
It went against the grain a little, in view of my earlier
distrust, but perhaps she was as good a starting-place
as any for my social career. And perhaps, in view of
the Chief’s wild suspicion of her, she was a shade better
than most people, as being at least remotely connected
with Margaret’s disappearance.</p>

<p>Later in the day, I told Larry that the search was
to continue and that Moore was going to help. I also
told him that he was to let Moore in at any time and ask
no questions, but that if he should happen to meet him
outside in any way, he was not to know him at all.</p>

<p>Traces of the green-eyed monster became apparent in
Larry at once. “Oh,” said he, “ ’tis himself will find her
no doubt, when we could not. But I’m thinkin’ he’s a
mysterious kind of a man altogether. Sure the next
toime I let him in, I’ll be keepin’ an eye on him pretty
close, the way he wouldn’t be bringin’ in some more of his
murtherin’ friends.”</p>

<p>This would never do. “Now look here, Larry,” I told
him, “this man Moore is my very good friend. And as
such he’s your very good friend too. Put that in your
pipe and smoke it, and don’t forget it. I can’t tell you
as much about things as I’d like to at present, but I can
tell you that this search is running us up against
something pretty stiff—and Moore’s a mighty good friend to
have in a pinch. If you don’t want to put the whole
thing on the fritz, do just what I’ve told you to, and
help Moore in any way possible. This is serious!”</p>

<p>Larry shifted from one foot to the other and then
suddenly he grinned in a sheepish way. “Sure, I was only
foolin’,” he said, and took himself off.</p>

<p>Never, from the beginning of our acquaintance, have
I had any doubts of Larry.</p>

<p>At eight that night I met Moore and we compared
notes over our dinner. I told him about finding that my
papers had been disturbed, and also that I had written to
Mrs. Furneau. Then he told me his news.</p>

<p>“Well, Clayton, I’ve taken a couple of rooms in the
house that is back to back with your apartment house.
It’s an old-fashioned place and I had no difficulty in
getting the rooms. Unfortunately, as you’re way up
on the eighth floor and I’m on the second in this place,
we’ll have some trouble running that wire. I think as
soon as we get through here we’d better get started on
it. Then we can take care of the outdoor part of it
later in the night.”</p>

<p>We were sitting in a sort of cubicle against the wall,
shut off from the others like it by the high wooden backs
of the seats. Each table was lit by a softly shaded
electric globe, which threw little light beyond the table,
and the rest of the room was but dimly lit.</p>

<p>In the middle of our conversation about our
house-to-house wire, I looked up to order our coffee, and
suddenly saw that the soft-footed Chinese boy was
standing quite close to Moore, although beyond the end of
the seat, so that I could only see his elbow. We had
spoken in very low tones and I thought nothing about it
at the time. But I had cause to remember that Chinese
boy later on.</p>

<p>A few moments later we left the restaurant
separately and made our way by separate routes to Moore’s
new rooms, to begin work on our private wire. It seemed
like making defensive preparations in advance before
declaring war. For even after Moore’s warning I failed to
realize fully that, with our murderous visitor that night
and the subsequent search of my papers, if such it was,
war had already been declared—and not by us.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="ch05">

<h2>Chapter V. <br> Our First Clew</h2>

<p>The house in which Moore had taken his rooms
was of the ordinary brown-stone type and had
once been occupied, presumably, by a single
family. Now, owing to changes in the neighborhood and
ever-mounting rents, it had been split up into
apartments.</p>

<p>The basement was occupied, he told me, by a grocer,
his wife and two children. The first floor served as
office and home for a young doctor, while the second
floor had been subdivided into two smaller apartments
of three rooms each, with a bathroom common to both,
Of these two, the front apartment belonged to a returned
soldier and his somewhat shrill-voiced French bride.
Moore had rented the back part of this floor, consisting of
a bedroom, a small kitchen and a living-room. The third
floor was unoccupied, but was similar in design to the
second.</p>

<p>The house was a large square one, each apartment on
the second floor being self-contained and well-lighted,
with the common bathroom between, lit only by a small
shaft and skylight above. The door to Moore’s rooms
was just at the head of the stairs and opened into his
living-room. This room looked out on to the back
garden, so called, as did his smaller bedroom beyond. His
kitchen was the same width as the hall and was the
continuation of it, but opened into his living-room and not
into the hall, so that the rooms had a single door into the
hall. This was fitted with a Yale lock.</p>

<p>The common bathroom was, of course, the difficulty
and was probably the reason why he had found the rooms
empty. With the somewhat embarrassing sociability of
some old southern and a few old New York houses, this
bathroom had three doors, one into the hall, one into
the front flat, and one at the back, into what was now
Moore’s bedroom. Of these, only the door into the hall
was now in use, the other two being nailed up.</p>

<p>There was only one door-bell to the house, which
rang in the basement, and for a small monthly gratuity
the grocer’s wife or one of her numerous children opened
the door for all visitors. The tenants had keys.</p>

<p>Moore got home first and was waiting at the front
door of the house to let me in. He ushered me proudly
into his living-room, furnished in seedy-looking plush
and china ornaments that looked as if they had been
manufactured by an absent-minded anarchist in his
moments of relaxation. The door was open into his
bedroom beyond, and the first thing I noticed was a lot of
wire lying on the floor in there.</p>

<p>“What’s all that—the telephone?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, I have put one instrument in already, and I have
the batteries and the instrument for your end. We’ll
put that in later. I’m a bit of an electrician and the
job was an easy one. As for my own instrument, I’m
going to keep it in my clothes closet and keep the closet
locked, you see. It will have a buzzer, but not a loud
one, so that you can get me when I’m here, but mostly I
imagine I’ll be calling you up. You see, I’ll have to have
a fashionable studio or something somewhere, to carry
out my part of the dilettante lounge lizard. This place
would never do as my official residence from a social point
of view. But it ought to be handy as an ‘earth’ perhaps.”</p>

<p>“What’s the idea of keeping it in the closet?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Well, some one will have to clean the room, and I
don’t want some estimable cleaning woman messing
about with it. Trust nobody is our motto, old boy.”</p>

<p>“And my end of it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, that doesn’t matter so much. You can trust
Larry, can’t you? We’ll put it in your bedroom, and
you can tell Larry not to let any one else in there. How’s
that?”</p>

<p>“That’s all right I should think,” I told him. “Now,
suppose we go over to my rooms and finish the job on
the other instrument, and then we can do the wiring
later, when all’s quiet?”</p>

<p>“Right,” he said; “and, Clayton! I forgot to tell
you that you have an account with the Guaranty Trust
on which you can draw up to any amount not out of
bounds of reason. Don’t forget that, because you may
need it. You won’t need to itemize your expenses. I
fixed that up with the Chief. Now let’s go.”</p>

<p>We spent an insane sort of a night. First of all we
installed the other instrument, batteries and induction
coil in my bedroom, with an additional buzzer in Larry’s
room for safety. We had no trouble in getting the thing
into working order.</p>

<p>But we decided that it was too early for the wiring,
so Moore and I sat talking and smoking until about
2 a.m. I also called in Larry, and told him that if the
buzzer rang at any time in my absence he was to drop
everything else and answer it, and to follow Moore’s
instructions to the limit.</p>

<p>Moore did another good bit of work that night all
on his own too, for he won Larry over completely.</p>

<p>It was amusing to watch. He got me to call Larry
in, and then he jumped to his feet, for the first time
dropping his drawl and his affected manner. “Look
here, Clayton,” he said, “we’re all in this together.
Suppose you introduce me, like a good fellow?”</p>

<p>I played up of course, and introduced them in due
form. Moore shook hands, smiling in a taking way he
had. “Glad to meet you, Larry,” he said. “I’ve heard
a lot about you and how you’ve stood by Clayton here.
Real friends aren’t so easily come by.”</p>

<p>Larry was covered with confusion, “Sure, sor,” he
stammered, “I ain’t done much.” Then he turned fiery
red.</p>

<p>“Nonsense! And look here, Larry. Clayton has let
me in on this search of his, so the three of us are all in
it together now. And I’m hoping that you’ll stand by
me too, if the occasion arises. From what I’ve heard of
you, I can’t think of a man I’d rather have in a pinch!”
He held out his hand again.</p>

<p>Larry hesitated a moment, and then reached out and
took it in a grasp of iron, his confidence suddenly
returning with the sudden and obvious liking induced by
Moore’s charm.</p>

<p>“I’ll do that same, sor,” he said simply.</p>

<p>Now I had not said a word to Moore about Larry’s
distrust of him. But Moore must have sensed it, and
my respect for my fellow-worker went up another notch.</p>

<p>It was some time after this that the melodramatic part
of the evening began. Larry entered into the spirit of the
thing. He ripped off the baseboard in my bedroom and
ran the telephone wires along it to the window. Here,
with a drill he bored a hole straight through the outside
wall of the house and ran the wires out on to the
fire-escape. Then he replaced the baseboard, so that not an
inch of wire showed in the room itself. We put the
instrument on a tiny table and put a big chair in front of it,
and then nothing showed at all.</p>

<p>When this was finished we climbed out on to the
fire-escape and prepared for the big task.</p>

<p>Luckily for us a rain-pipe ran straight down alongside
the fire-escape to the ground. Moore had bought
thousands of brads, and with these we fastened the double
wire to the brickwork, getting the wire as nearly as
possible behind the pipe and out of sight. But it was
awkward work, leaning far out from the fire-escape and
nailing the wire in behind like that.</p>

<p>This was not the worst of it, however. For we had
to work in pitch darkness and without making a sound.
We dared not flash a light, for fear we might be seen
from one of the houses near by. And the tiny noise
we made with the hammer kept us on the <i>qui vive</i> most
of the time.</p>

<p>There was a funny side to it too. As we clambered
lower and lower on the iron structure, we passed window
after window of respectable apartment owners, now
lost in slumber and “little dreaming” of the fell deeds
that were going on just outside their windows. Once
Larry slipped and swore under his breath in the most
approved style, and I grabbed for him, shaking with
laughter, and bade him keep quiet. Somehow, working
with Moore lent the whole business a spice of
melodramatic comedy that stood out in striking relief against
the dark background of what came after. But our work
that night, arduous as it was, was glamored with a
humorous good-fellowship very welcome after six months of
despairing anxiety.</p>

<p>We reached the ground without mishap, unrolling and
tacking up the wire as we went. There we ran it along
the base of the building against the ground and up to a
wooden fence that divided the yard of the apartment house
from the one next door. We covered it as well as we
could with dirt so that it would not show.</p>

<p>We had little difficulty with the wire. The fence was
a high affair made of wooden palings dovetailed together
and finished off at the top with a flat board, about two
inches wide, which extended out beyond the palings a
little on either side. Larry ran the wires along the top
of this fence, under the eave of this top board, where it
could not be seen, until he reached the back fence. We
climbed this and ran the wire along the side fence of the
yard of Moore’s house and up to the house itself. But
here we stuck. For while there was a rain-pipe near his
bedroom window, there was no fire-escape to help us
reach it. But Moore solved this problem. He went back
the way we had come, climbed the fire-escape again to
the eighth floor and let himself quietly out the front door
of my apartment, shutting the door after him. Then he
went round the block to the front door of his new abode,
let himself in with his key and went up to his own rooms.
He had an ordinary telephone here, and on this he called
up the young doctor who lived on the floor below, begging
that infuriated young man to hurry around to my
apartment.</p>

<p>In the meantime I hurried back up the fire-escape and
prepared to receive him.</p>

<p>As soon as the doctor had dressed and started on his
visit, Moore descended and opened his front door with
a skeleton key. He made his way to the doctor’s back
windows, and, with the aid of Larry from below, managed
to run the wire up to where it could be reached from his
own window. At the same time Larry made a burglarious
entry into the doctor’s rooms through the window, and
after shutting the windows and leaving all tidy, he and
Moore closed the doctor’s front door again and went on
up to Moore’s rooms, where, with his drill, Larry brought
the wire through the house wall and along under the
footboard to the closet, connected it up and made a finished
job of our telephone.</p>

<p>In the meantime I had hastily got out of my coat and
vest, changed my canvas shoes for bedroom slippers, and
had climbed into a dressing-gown and mussed up my
hair. When the sleepy young doctor got there I was
looking pale and interesting and suffering from a variety of
afflictions obviously beyond his simple powers of
diagnosis. I think he vacillated between appendicitis,
galloping consumption and epileptic fits, but I must admit my
descriptions of my symptoms was both confused and
confusing. Finally, however, he gave it up, mentally
washed his hands of the case, and prescribed a simple
remedy which I recognized as something in the nature of
a faith cure. He then advised me to consult a specialist
and took his annoyed and sleepy departure. But I had
kept him there for nearly an hour, and I knew that
Moore and Larry must have finished their job.</p>

<p>Moore had insisted upon a <i>bona-fide</i> call, as otherwise,
if we had sent the young doctor on a wild-goose chase,
he would have become suspicious and looked for and
possibly found traces of Moore’s presence in his rooms,
which might have led to all sorts of complications.
Anyhow, I never paid a doctor’s bill with a stronger sense of
value received than when I paid his a little later.</p>

<p>Larry returned about dawn and, as the doorman knew
him, got back to the flat again without difficulty.</p>

<p>Our telephone was completed without a hitch and
was in running order, as I soon ascertained by ringing up
Moore. Then we settled down to a well-earned sleep,
Larry at least in a state of pleasurable excitement.</p>

<p>The following week marked the début of Moore and
myself in the social game. Moore took a studio in
Greenwich Village, furnished it superbly, dabbled in sculpture
and invited his ever-growing circle of friends and
acquaintances to come to tea, discuss art and view what he
described to me as his atrocities.</p>

<p>For my part, I visited old friends in search of
introductions in what I thought might be likely quarters and
followed these up assiduously. Moore maintained his
dilettante pose and went in for the milder forms of
dissipations and indiscretions, doing his best to attain the
appearance of evil without boring himself with the thing
itself. I followed his advice and took to myself the pose
of a disillusioned worldling of esthetic tastes.</p>

<p>Night after night we held long conversations over our
telephone, comparing notes so as to avoid each other’s
tracks as much as possible. In this way we seldom saw
each other.</p>

<p>However, I came across his traces once or twice. In
answer to a charming letter from Mrs. Furneau, I called
and did my best to convince her that I had given up all
hope of finding Margaret. I was cynical, disillusioned
and self-centered to a point where I wondered how she
could stand having me in the house.</p>

<p>However, she was most charming and sympathetic,
introduced me to a number of her friends and invited
me to become a regular caller at her pretty brown-stone
house. She had a distinct charm of manner, arising from
her perfect confidence in herself and her power to please,
and I found her circle a wide one and promising for my
purpose. Here one afternoon, much to my amazement,
I overheard two feminine social butterflies discussing
Moore.</p>

<p>“You know, my dear, he must have heaps of money
to keep that place going—and he never works except
at his sculpting, and I’m sure he never makes any money
at that.”</p>

<p>“They say he’s fearfully dissipated,” cut in the other.
“But I thought he was charming. Such a bored air and
so perfectly self-possessed. He told me that I
understood him as no one else did.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I dare say,” answered the first, unsheathing a
claw. “He really needs some pure young thing like
you to take him in hand and reform him. It’s such a
pity to see him going to pieces like that.”</p>

<p>At this point I moved away, overcome by my
emotions; but I repeated the whole conversation to Moore
later on and advised him to seize his chance of reform
if she gave it to him.</p>

<p>But it was about ten days after we first launched
ourselves upon society that Moore got what he believed
to be our first clew.</p>

<p>I had come home late from a small private dance,
bewildered and bored by the shifting panorama of small
intrigues and light love affairs impossible to avoid
seeing.</p>

<p>I sat in my bedroom, slowly undressing and
wondering what future lay ahead for these girls when some of
their charm was gone, when I heard the familiar buzz
of our private line. This must be something special,
because we had already compared notes of our evening’s
plans at dinner-time.</p>

<p>Moore’s voice was tense. “Hello, Clayton? Good!
Damned glad you’re home. Old man, I think there’s
something stirring at last!”</p>

<p>“Great! What is it?”</p>

<p>“Well, you know I went up to a party on Riverside
Drive to-night. My host made his pile doing
construction work for innocent and confiding suburban
municipalities. Now I guess he’s trying to drown his memories
in one of the finest cellars in New York and finding plenty
of friends to help him. I never saw him before and I
never want to see him again, except in the way of our
business, but I got what I think is a clew there, and that’s
the main thing.”</p>

<p>“Go on, I’m listening.”</p>

<p>“It was just before I left. I’d gone to one of the
bedrooms used as a men’s cloak-room, to get my hat. The
party had been pretty wild—one woman nearly had her
clothes torn off her by our playful and animated
host—and I was straightening up a bit when a young fellow
blew in, looking for <em>his</em> hat.</p>

<p>“I’d already spotted him as a well-known young rip,
with a lot more money than either wits or decency, and
I’d been casually introduced to him in the early part
of the evening. But now he fell on me like a long-lost
friend. ‘Not a bad party, eh?’ said he. ‘But the women
aren’t up to much. Too damned stand-offish for my taste.
Only the same old booze, too. Gee, you oughta been on
the party I was on th’ other nigh’. Say, I thought I was
’n heaven.’</p>

<p>“I tried to shake him off and get out of there, but
he wasn’t having any. ‘Wai’ a minut’, I wan’ tell ya
’bout it,’ he said, in an injured tone, so I waited.</p>

<p>“He held a waving finger before me and went on: ‘I’
was like par’dise, I tell ya. I dunno what they gave us,
but I was lost to the worl’ till the next mornin’. They
kept me there all nigh’.’</p>

<p>“ ‘Where was it?’ I asked him.</p>

<p>“ ‘Damned ’finno. Somewhere out town. But ol’
Babylon and Corinth hadn’t a thing on that party. I
paid $200 to go, an’ I wouldn’t ’a’ missed it for a
thousand—girls an’ divans and strange things to drink that
gave ya the most won’erful dreams, Gee, what a party!
They tol’ me special that I wasn’t even to mention it,
but that’s only a a’vertising dodge. Ya can’t fool me.
That was one of the conditions. Made me swear not to
tell before they’d take me!’ He went off into fits of
laughter here.</p>

<p>“Some one else came in just then,” Moore continued,
“and I noticed that the new-comer stared pretty hard for
an instant at the young hopeful. I don’t know why.
Anyhow this fellow had some more to say that convinced
me he might be useful.”</p>

<p>“Sounds like drugs, doesn’t it?” I cut in.</p>

<p>“Wait,” Moore continued. “When this young fellow
had stopped laughing I pumped him gently about the
party.</p>

<p>“ ‘I dunno,’ he said, ‘what they gave us. Must ’a’
been some kind of drug, for I had a rotten head the next
day.’</p>

<p>“I asked him again where it was.</p>

<p>“ ‘Search me,’ he answered. ‘They took me there in
a closed car and brought me away in one. Mighta been
anywhere a’most.’</p>

<p>“At this point,” Moore continued, “the fellow looked
up and caught the new-comer’s eye and it seemed to
sober him. He smiled in a sickly sort of a way and
began a wild search for his hat. The other man went
out right after that. But I had a good look at him,
and I think I know who he is. Anyhow, the young rip
wouldn’t talk any more—seemed scared and sobered—and
I came away. But I got the young fellow’s address
from him.”</p>

<p>“What’s your idea?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Why, follow him up and try to find out who asked
him to the party. Then work it so that you or I get an
invitation.”</p>

<p>“Sounds promising,” I said.</p>

<p>“You bet it does,” said Moore. “Anyhow, I’ll follow
it up to-morrow. I’ll try to get in touch with the young
rip and wheedle some information out of him. But I
knew you’d want to know about it first. Besides, it’s
as well to keep in touch with each other’s movements,
I think. This young fellow lives on West 44th Street, in
the Branscombe. I’ll go up there to-morrow afternoon.”</p>

<p>“Right. Good luck!” I answered with a good deal
of feeling.</p>

<p>“Any news at your end?” Moore inquired.</p>

<p>“Not yet,” I told him reluctantly, and we rang off.</p>

<p>But, as you shall see, that night marked the end of the
overture and the rising of the curtain on the first act of
what was to prove a very serious drama.</p>

</div>

<hr class="x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter" id="ch06">

<h2>Chapter VI. <br> The Girl in Gray</h2>

<p>The following afternoon I had an engagement for
tea with Mrs. Furneau. She had told me to
come early, ostensibly because we were to have
a quiet talk over some plans for amateur theatricals. But
since our second meeting I had made a good deal of an
effort to please her, and our friendship was on a more or
less intimate basis at this time.</p>

<p>It had not been necessary to pretend to much
admiration, for Mrs. Furneau was a charming woman. But
where Margaret’s fate might be even slightly concerned
I had none of the scruples I might otherwise have felt.
Therefore, I had made my admiration for the lady more
evident than was perhaps necessary, hoping for the time
when our growing intimacy might give me the opportunity
to question her suddenly about my sister and possibly
learn something, if there were anything to learn, for my
former suspicion of her had somehow faded, as I knew
her better.</p>

<p>So, about half-past three, I pulled myself together,
assumed a most cynical and disillusioned expression, and
set forth for her house.</p>

<p>Our conversation that afternoon, before the arrival
of her other guests, was of a more or less personal nature
and consisted mainly of subtleties, of which the lady was
a past mistress.</p>

<p>Once, however, she referred to the subject never
absent from my thoughts: “Jack,” she said, after a pause
and speaking a little wistfully, I thought, “have you really
given up all hope of finding your sister?”</p>

<p>She reached out and touched my hand delicately, to
soften the reminder if she could.</p>

<p>I nodded. “What’s the use? I’ve looked everywhere
and it’s hopeless. Don’t let’s talk about it. Don’t worry
about it, but let me go to the devil in my own way.” I
smiled bitterly.</p>

<p>I glanced away from her, but when I looked back again
her eyes were on me with a keenness of scrutiny that I
had never seen before in them. There was a little furrow
between her pretty brows too. But she contented herself
with—“It doesn’t seem like you, somehow.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps not!” I retorted. “But when there isn’t
a single shred of a trace to go on, what can I do?”</p>

<p>She hesitated a moment. “I didn’t ask just to hurt
you. I expect Mrs. Fawcette here this afternoon, later
on. It was at her house that I took Margaret to luncheon
that wretched day, you remember. And I did not know
whether you would rather see her again and perhaps
question her further, or go away before she comes. She
went away, you remember, soon after that, on one of her
globe-trotting jaunts or something. And I thought,
perhaps——”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t mind seeing her again, if that’s what
you mean,” I answered, though I had never even thought
of questioning Mrs. Fawcette very closely, except to verify
the fact that Margaret had left with Mrs. Furneau a
little after five. And I realized at that moment that
perhaps I had been careless there.</p>

<p>“But as for questioning her again,” I added, “what’s
the use?”</p>

<p>Helen Furneau shrugged her shoulders. “Well, I
thought I’d tell you, anyway.”</p>

<p>“I appreciate that,” I told her.</p>

<p>“She’s a queer woman,” Mrs. Furneau went on. “She
used to be ultra-conservative, before her husband died.
But since she’s been wandering around the globe, with
nothing in particular to occupy her, she’s taken on a
crowd that even I would call queer. And I don’t believe
anybody ever accused me of conservatism.” She laughed
whimsically.</p>

<p>Naturally I pricked up my ears at that, though I
don’t think I showed it. Anyway, I turned the
conversation back to my charming hostess a moment later.</p>

<p>Presently the guests began to arrive. They were the
usual mixed lot of artists and professionals, with a rich
sprinkling of foreigners, for whom Helen Furneau had
a particular <i>penchant</i>.</p>

<p>I was deep in cynical platitudes with a round-bodied
and rat-eyed little cubist who looked as if he needed
scrubbing, when Helen called my name.</p>

<p>She stood at my elbow and, turning, I found myself
facing the loveliest girl I had ever seen. She was dressed
in gray—clinging, filmy stuff—with a big gray floppy
hat. I took that much in before Mrs. Furneau completed
the introduction. Then the girl’s big gray eyes met mine
gravely, lingered a moment taking me in, and fell away
from mine with just a hint of shyness. She was
obviously quite young and obviously out of place in that
<i>galère</i>.</p>

<p>I was introduced in turn to her aunt, a fussy and
voluble person, by all external signs; of the kind that
rushes in and so forth. That over, I turned to the girl
again with an inward sigh of relief. If I must talk to
rat-eyed cubists for the sake of my search, there could be
no harm in a few moments off duty in such obviously
wholesome company.</p>

<p>During my introduction to her aunt, Miss Van Cleef
had stood close to our hostess, and while I made the
remark or two to her aunt which convention required,
the girl was talking to Mrs. Furneau. She was speaking
as I joined them.</p>

<p>“. . . most wonderful stuff I ever tasted. You must
go and get them to give you some. They <em>were</em> funny
people, though. I don’t believe I like them very——”</p>

<p>She stopped as I came up to them. Clearly she and my
hostess were on the best of terms.</p>

<p>The three of us talked about nothing in particular
for a moment, and then Mrs. Furneau hurried away to
greet newer arrivals and I led the girl to a seat.</p>

<p>She came from Utica, I learned, had never been in
New York before this visit to her aunt, and before long
I had her embarked on a description of her impressions
of the people she had met in her aunt’s circle. In the
meantime I studied the lovely face. From the point of
view of a painter of portraits the features were almost
perfect. And with all the beauty of wide gray eyes,
straight, delicate nose and crimson, sweetly curving lips,
she had that added something—expression, spirit,
feeling, call it what you will—that made the lovely features
really beautiful. I could hardly credit her, even as I sat
and watched her.</p>

<p>Presently she faltered and colored faintly and I drew
my eyes hastily away. Then, more to cover the momentary
embarrassment than anything else, I reverted to the
remark which I had overheard.</p>

<p>“Won’t you tell me what was the most wonderful stuff
you ever tasted?” I inquired.</p>

<p>She laughed gayly. “Oh, my aunt took, me to a funny
party this afternoon, before we came here. There were
all sorts of queer people there, and I—I didn’t care for
it very much. But they gave me some of the most
wonderful tea you can imagine. It almost reconciled me to
the people for a while. I felt sort of dreamy, as though
I loved the whole world. And then afterwards”—she
laughed a little shyly—“I liked them all less than ever.
There must have been something queer in it.”</p>

<p>My first thought was delight at the girl’s entire
ingenuousness. But a moment later the full significance
of her words came to me, and I realized that here might
be the clew for which we had been searching for so
long.</p>

<p>“How extraordinary!” I laughed. “But are you sure
that it was the tea and not just a sudden mood?”</p>

<p>My companion shook her head. “No,” she answered
positively, “I know the sort of mood you mean, But
this was something much more distinct and engrossing.
Why, for a little while everything seemed to expand or
contract in the queerest way. I’m afraid I can’t explain
very well. But everything there—all the people and
even the things in the room—seemed to have delightful
and wonderful qualities, and—— I’m afraid that doesn’t
sound very coherent?” she broke off, laughing.</p>

<p>“It is quite coherent,” I responded, “though strange
enough, surely. But——” I broke off and looked into
her eyes.</p>

<p>“But what?”</p>

<p>I was silent a moment. “But I wonder,” I went on,
“whether I might become socially impossible for a moment
and say something serious?”</p>

<p>The lovely eyes met mine in frank surprise and
inquiry.</p>

<p>“. . . and I wonder whether that sort of thing is good
for one?” I finished.</p>

<p>She laughed. “That’s not very serious, Mr. Clayton.
No, I don’t suppose that sort of thing is at all good for
one. But you New Yorkers do not make that a criterion
of your actions, surely?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps <em>we</em> do not!” I answered gravely.</p>

<p>“But that’s no reason why I shouldn’t?” she demanded,
smiling. “There you go, trying to keep all the privileges
for yourselves. I think I like New York and I want lots
of privileges!”</p>

<p>I laughed. “Do you expect to be here long?” I
asked.</p>

<p>“About a month, I think.”</p>

<p>“Well, you ought to see about enough of New York
in that time. And I hereby extend you the freedom
of the city with all its privileges. But I hope you will
extend me one in return?”</p>

<p>At this moment her aunt bustled up to us. “Natalie,
my dear, you must come and meet the Jordans. Such
dear people and <em>so</em> unusual. Two of my best friends,
you know.”</p>

<p>She turned to me, beaming. “You will excuse us, Mr.
Clayton?”</p>

<p>Miss Van Cleef rose gracefully to her feet. In spite
of a little momentary trick of shyness now and then,
she was clearly a young lady with a good deal of natural
poise. She turned to me for an instant, before following
her aunt.</p>

<p>“And the boon you ask?” she inquired, laughing.</p>

<p>“Just to see something of you while you are here,”
answered I gravely.</p>

<p>Again the lovely eyes met mine in surprise. I tried
to make my glance express nothing more than a friendly
interest, but it is possible that a little of my growing
wonder and admiration showed for an instant.</p>

<p>“Natalie!” her aunt called her a little impatiently.</p>

<p>My companion colored adorably and dropped her eyes.
“I—why, of course, if you—wish it,” she murmured.</p>

<p>An instant later she had joined her aunt. But I stood
still, conscious of quickening pulses. And for an instant,
before I was drawn into the general conversation about
me, I forgot my mission there and the work I had set
myself to do and became enmeshed in a day-dream, full
of vague thoughts and fancies, leading I knew not whither.</p>

<p>But not for long. In the middle of a discussion on
Freud, my hostess moved past me with a smile that held
something of meaning in it, and I looked up to see her
welcoming a tall woman, strikingly handsome, whose face
I recognized at once.</p>

<p>But I should not have recognized her if her face had
not been engraved on my memory by the force of
association with tragedy. For I remembered Mrs.
Fawcette as an ultra-conservative, conventional woman—a
woman who was socially powerful and knew it, and one
whose speech and attire were as conservative as her
views. And now!</p>

<p>She wore a long flowing “art” gown of the most
amazing shade of orange fading into lavender. She wore
long green earrings, hanging nearly to her shoulder. Her
chestnut hair, once so beautifully coiffured, now escaped
in wisps from beneath her big, flopping hat, and from
her head to her heels she was “of art, arty”!</p>

<p>But after a second glance I realized that the change
in her attire was perhaps not the most striking change
after all. The handsome face was still hard—still held
something of dominance in its level glance—but the
mouth had sagged a little, there were heavy lines under
the eyes, the eyes themselves were less clear, and the
whole face had deteriorated. It was much like
approaching a house, handsome in the distance, only to find it
deserted and falling into ruins on closer inspection.</p>

<p>As a portrait painter, I have naturally studied faces.
But I have never before or since seen so great a change
in a face without a definite cause to which the change
could be ascribed. It was not a good face, at all events,
of that I was very certain.</p>

<p>Mrs. Furneau smilingly signed to me to join her, and
I was presently shaking hands with Mrs. Fawcette. Her
manner was most cordial, but I did not feel that she was
particularly glad to see me.</p>

<p>“I hear you have been round the world since last we
met,” I told her.</p>

<p>“Oh, no! Just a fairly long stay in Egypt, a little off
the beaten track.”</p>

<p>“What enthusiasm!” I remarked. “Life is a poor
shabby thing at best, so I don’t see that it matters much
where we spend it. But I dare say you enjoyed
yourself?”</p>

<p>My manner was languid and my words evoked a glance
of surprise from my hostess. But I imagine that she
took it into her head that my attitude had some sort of
a purpose—as indeed it had, though not the humorous
one she suspected—for she smiled slightly and moved
away.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fawcette had found a seat on a sofa while we
were talking, and I sat down beside her without an
invitation.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, thank you, I enjoyed myself,” she answered
a little sharply.</p>

<p>“How extraordinary,” I answered; “I thought that
faculty was—dead, in most of us.”</p>

<p>She turned and stared at me, suspiciously. “Well, it
isn’t dead in me, at all events!” she snapped; “although
your remarks might imply that you think it ought to
be!”</p>

<p>I was secretly delighted to find that she had so
quick a temper. For I hoped that reaction might
loosen her tongue, if there was anything to learn from
her.</p>

<p>I sat up as though stung. “My dear lady, I had no
thought of implying any such thing. If my words sounded
discourteous I beg that you will pardon them. To tell
you the truth, you may remember that I suffered a
terrible loss some months ago, and I’m afraid that that has
made me self-centered as well as costing me my own
capacity for enjoyment. You remember?”</p>

<p>It seemed to me that my companion started slightly,
and for an instant my heart stood still with a sudden
fierce hope. But she answered smoothly enough:</p>

<p>“You poor man, of course I remember it. But surely
you found your sister again. I have been away, you see,
and——”</p>

<p>I shook my head. “No, I never found her—and now
I am trying to forget.”</p>

<p>I glanced at my companion, but she was looking
down at her hands. “You have stopped trying to find
her?” she inquired, without looking up.</p>

<p>“What is the use?”</p>

<p>There was a moment’s silence.</p>

<p>Then: “I think, perhaps, you are wise!” said my
companion. “After all, she probably ran away with some
one and is quite happy.” She looked up at me at last.
“And I am sure you will regain your capacity for
enjoyment.”</p>

<p>Her glance lingered a moment, and for the first time
I became aware of a queer fascination of which she
seemed to have the power. She was undoubtedly a
handsome woman, and her long, narrow eyes could
express a great deal in a queer, elusive way.</p>

<p>“I feel that I am regaining it momentarily,” I
answered. I could have taken her and cheerfully choked
her for the callous way in which she had referred to my
sister, fascination or no fascination, but that would not
have advanced my cause at all. I was beginning to be
suspicious of every one, and Mrs. Fawcette had been
one of the last people to see Margaret.</p>

<p>She smiled into my eyes then, a strange, elusive smile
that was yet vaguely repellent. “You are pleased to
be facetious,” she said.</p>

<p>“Indeed, no. Of all interests a human interest is the
keenest. And when that interest is beautiful——” I
sighed.</p>

<p>I felt her hand touch mine for a fleeting instant.
“Come,” she answered, “you must not flirt with me on
such short acquaintance!” But she smiled into my
eyes.</p>

<p>“And when our acquaintance is not so short?” I
demanded.</p>

<p>She rose to her feet and I got up and faced her, “—If
you will permit me to lengthen it,” I added.</p>

<p>She laughed provocatively. “Why, then we shall see
what we shall see,” she answered.</p>

<p>She left me then, and presently I took leave of my
hostess and came away. I had learned little or nothing
either from Mrs. Fawcette or from any one. But I was
anything but ill-pleased with my afternoon. For at
least I had paved the way for a closer acquaintance with
that rather dangerous-looking lady. And I had learned
something of interest from the Girl in Gray. My pulses
quickened again reminiscently at the thought and I shook
myself impatiently. Such things and such thoughts were
not for me until I had solved my problem and found
Margaret.</p>

<hr>

<p>Larry met me at my door in high excitement. “Sure
’tis glad I am you’re back agin, sor. That there private
’phone’s been ringing like mad fer the last hour. Ivery
minute, Misther Moore wants to know are ye back yit.
He must have something important to tell ye, sor. There!
There it goes again.”</p>

<p>I gave my hat, stick and gloves to Larry and hurried
into my bedroom. Yes, the tiny ’phone bell was ringing
faintly.</p>

<p>“Hello, Moore? This is Clayton. You want me?”</p>

<p>“At last,” came Moore’s voice over the wire. “You
bet I want you. Clayton, I believe we’re on the right
track at last!”</p>

<p>“How’s that?”</p>

<p>“You remember my telling you about the young drunk
I met up on Riverside Drive last night?”</p>

<p>“Of course!”</p>

<p>“Well, I went up to his place this afternoon—on
West 44th Street—and found everything at sixes and
sevens. There were a lot of young fellows of his type
hanging around in the flat, to say nothing of three or
four peroxide blondes, and his man was nearly in tears.
It seems this chap can’t be found. He didn’t come home
at all last night and they haven’t heard from him. In
short, he has disappeared. He had appointments with
a lot of them for the morning and afternoon and evening,
and one of the beauties remarked tearfully that it wasn’t
like Jimmy to break a date with a bit of fluff. But there
it is. He’s gone. His valet was just about to get in
touch with the police when I left.”</p>

<p>“What do you make of it?” I inquired.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you, Clayton. Of course I may be wrong.
The young rip may have been worse soused than he
looked, and may be sobering up in some local police
station. But I don’t think it was that. I didn’t like
the way the other fellow looked at him in the
cloak-room last night while he was talking about that party.
The young fellow didn’t like it either. And he told me
that he had been forbidden to talk about that party.
I think that that had something to do with his
disappearance. Of course all this is only guess-work, but it looks
queer, doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Well,” I answered, “if he disappeared because he
talked at that party and he disappeared last night, the
people he offended and who gave the party must be fast
workers.”</p>

<p>“That’s just it. If he has disappeared completely and
doesn’t turn up, I think that’s the most probable
explanation. And only a well-organized gang could work
that fast. So it may be the same gang.”</p>

<p>“What about the other fellow? Did you trace him?”
I asked.</p>

<p>“The man who overheard us? Yes. But I haven’t
had a chance to talk to him or get acquainted yet. His
name is Vining, as I thought, and he’s a young doctor
with independent means. I guess he’s a better cocktail
mixer than a surgeon. Has an office on West End Avenue.
They say he limits his cases to attractive women. But
every one agrees that he is clever.”</p>

<p>“I hope he’s not too clever for us!” I answered. “But
we can’t tell much about it until we see whether the
young man turns up or not. What do you think?”</p>

<p>“Well,” Moore answered, “I hate to lose time, but
I suppose it’s no use jumping to conclusions. What’s
your news?”</p>

<p>I told him what had happened to me that afternoon,
including my own clew, which I believed I had found
in the description of the tea which the Girl in Gray had
had.</p>

<p>Finally we agreed to follow each his own line for the
present, always keeping the other informed of the
progress made. Indeed there was little else that we could
do as yet.</p>

<h2>Chapter VII. <br> The Famous Tea</h2>

<p>In spite of the promise of recent events and the
possible clews which Moore and I believed we had
found, the next three weeks were uneventful.
Uneventful, that is, from the standpoint of our quest, though
eventful enough to me personally.</p>

<p>I was a languid and cynical guest at many high-brow
and low-brow gatherings. I discussed Turgenieff,
spiritualism, psycho-analysis, free love, and so forth at the
one until my ears burned; and polo, the
Dempsey-Carpentier match, women, politics and stocks at the other
until I could start my tongue going and go away and leave
it. But I made little progress and unearthed no fresh
clews.</p>

<p>I did make a little progress, however.</p>

<p>For one thing, I cultivated the acquaintanceship of
Mrs. Fawcette until it ripened into something much
more intimate, though vague and undefined. She was,
I found, an interesting woman, well-traveled and
well-read, and, better still, with very definite views on most
things. She had a clever gift of repartee, as I learned
to my cost, for I found myself several times considerably
beyond my depth and somewhat at a loss. Her views
were strikingly, glaringly liberal, and although I
attempted to match her in cynical disregard of the
conventions of conversation, I think she suspected that my
views were not quite so disillusioned and opportunistic
as I tried to make them appear. At all events she seemed
to take a secret delight in attempting to startle me, and
succeeded better than, I hope, she guessed. But I got
no news from her.</p>

<p>However, I formed a real friendship during those
three weeks which meant far more to me, however little
it might mean to our quest. For I arranged a second
opportunity to meet and talk with the Girl in Gray, as
I like to call her. And after that I obtained her
permission, and that of her aunt, to call upon them. After
that call and a theater party which I gave for them, we
were good friends. It was my playtime, before the
serious part of our quest began, and it meant more to me
than I can express. Natalie Van Cleef took her many
social experiences and the many strange specimens she
met during her energetic aunt’s peregrinations with a
ready sympathy and a sweet reserve that were inspiring
to watch. She was welcome everywhere, as much for
her lovely personality as for her beauty, but somehow
she contrived to be a welcome addition to each circle
without being exactly of it. She was essentially
innocent without being ignorant, so that the unconventional
moods and tenses with which she came into contact left
her comprehending, at least in part, and yet quite
untouched in her own sweet, calm, and slightly shy
personality.</p>

<p>To me during those days she was like a breath of sea
air in a crowded department store, or a bunch of roses
on a tramp steamer, and before many days had passed
she filled most of my waking thoughts and many of
my dreams. We saw a good deal of each other and had
many happy days together, days so happy, at least to
me, that I can never think of them without a catch in the
throat and a tightening of the hands, in view of what came
after. For as our friendship ripened I grew to realize
that her mind and spirit were as sweet and lovely and
gracious as her person.</p>

<p>Moore accomplished little more than I did, during
those three weeks. The young fellow from whom he
had obtained his first hint of a circle of drug-takers <i>de
luxe</i> had in truth disappeared, and being a wealthy
young man of considerable social position, his
disappearance became a nine-days’ wonder. But for all that,
no trace of him was found, and Moore and I decided
that our first surmise that his lack of reticence that night
had been the cause of his disappearance was the correct
one.</p>

<p>Moore did, however, get in touch with the young
doctor who had overheard that conversation, and after
a while succeeded in making his acquaintance. Vining
apparently took to him at once, and when Moore
carelessly mentioned the fact that he had independent means,
which was lucky, because the public and the dealers were
hardly sufficiently educated to appreciate his ideas on
art, Vining contrived to see a good deal of him, aided
and abetted by Moore himself.</p>

<p>Once or twice, Moore vaguely skirted the subject of his
conversation that night with the young fellow who had
disappeared, but Vining displayed a bland ignorance of
any such conversation or of any place where such a party
as the young man had described could be found.</p>

<p>However, Moore did not despair, but continued to
cultivate the friendship, in his effeminate and
lackadaisical way, until presently Vining knew all about his
passion for new and outlandish sensations.</p>

<p>But events were shaping themselves for us both
during those weeks, and the end of our period of inactivity
came suddenly and at the same time to both.</p>

<p>A few days before Natalie planned to leave New York,
Mrs. Furneau arranged a little luncheon to which I
had the honor of being invited. Among others, the
luncheon included Mrs. Fawcette, and I hope that I shall
never be called upon to sit through a more trying two
hours. For I had fallen almost unconsciously into the
habit of being very much myself when Natalie and I
were alone together, and my change of manner when
talking to Mrs. Fawcette, and to Mrs. Furneau for that
matter, must have been striking.</p>

<p>I caught Natalie looking at me once or twice in a
puzzled way during the luncheon, but so far as the quest
was concerned, it would have been more costly to strike
a false or inconsistent note in their ears than in the ears
of Natalie; so that I was forced to carry on a miserably
cynical, disillusioned and world-weary conversation with
my hostess and with Mrs. Fawcette, sick at heart all the
time at the half-concealed surprise in Natalie’s eyes.</p>

<p>It had to be done now, but I regretted adopting such
a pose in the first place.</p>

<p>It was a little better after luncheon, however. I
had taken upon myself the position of an admirer of
both my hostess and Mrs. Fawcette, but I contrived,
with some difficulty, to have a word or two with Natalie
away from the others. We had always been frank with
each other and this conversation was no exception,
although she was just a little cool at first.</p>

<p>“I’m—I’m very, very sorry that you are going away,”
I told her.</p>

<p>“Are you? I should not imagine that anything would
have the power to make you either very, very sorry or
very, very glad.”</p>

<p>“Natalie!”</p>

<p>She looked down for a moment, and when she looked
up again she was her usual friendly, frank self. “Well
then, why do you talk in that disillusioned way? It
isn’t a bit like you.”</p>

<p>I was silent. Then, taking a wild leap in the dark,
I tried to be equally frank, whatever the consequences.</p>

<p>“Natalie, I know it isn’t like me. It isn’t even a
real side of me. But I had to do it to-day, as I have had
to do it before. There is a real and vital reason. And
that is all I can tell you. Do you believe me?”</p>

<p>She looked up, laughing. Then, as her eyes met mine,
her smile faded into a look of wonder. “Do you really
mean that?” she demanded.</p>

<p>“I really mean just that,” I assured her earnestly;
“and I really mean that I simply cannot tell you any
more than that.”</p>

<p>“But—but—why, that is absurd. Why can’t you be
yourself?”</p>

<p>I shook my head despairingly. “Natalie, I have told
you the truth. I don’t lie much anyway; and our
friendship means far too much to me for me to lie to you of all
people. But I cannot tell you any more than that!”</p>

<p>She stared at me for a moment or two, and then I
realized for the first time, perhaps, what a really
wonderful girl she was. For her hand went out impulsively
to my sleeve and the eyes she raised to mine were full of
sincerity. “I believe you, then,” she said simply, “and
your reason does not matter.”</p>

<p>I must have let some of my appreciation show in my
eyes, for she flushed a delicious pink and dropped her
own quickly. I leaned a little nearer to her: “And you
see I can still be very, very glad about something!” I
told her.</p>

<p>She changed the subject rather hastily.</p>

<p>“Do you remember my telling you about some
wonderful tea I had had, just before our first meeting?”
she asked.</p>

<p>I hastened to assure her that I did remember, although
we had discussed that tea several times and wondered
about its peculiar properties.</p>

<p>“Well, Mrs. Fawcette has promised me some more
of it, and she is taking me there to tea this afternoon!”</p>

<p>“To the same place?” I asked. Her words filled me
with a vague apprehension, perhaps because by now
I hated the thought of associating her closely with
anything that had to do with my quest.</p>

<p>“Yes, to the same place. <em>Now</em> what’s the matter?”
she added, laughing.</p>

<p>“Well,” I answered, “frankly, I hate the thought of
your taking drugs of any kind, however mild. You don’t
belong in that crowd, Natalie.”</p>

<p>She laughed. “Oh, but I must have some more of
that tea, if only to convince myself that there was
nothing in it, and that my queer mood <em>was</em> only a
mood.”</p>

<p>“Well, if you must go there, somehow I wish you’d
let me go with you! I know it’s a funny request, and
I don’t quite know why I don’t want you to go there
without me—but I don’t!” I felt very young and
awkward with that speech. But there was so little that I
could tell her to warn her. And I did <em>not</em> trust either
Mrs. Fawcette or her friends. I had seen something of
them, and they were a queer crowd, to say the least.</p>

<p>Natalie looked up at me curiously. “You are in a
funny mood to-day,” she said. “But if you want to
come along, I should think Mrs. Fawcette would be
delighted to take you!” It was unlike her, but I seemed
to feel something of a challenge in her last remark.</p>

<p>Before I could answer, however, she had turned to
that lady, who was sitting near by.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Fawcette,” she called gayly, “Mr. Clayton is
dying to come to the tea with us this afternoon. Do you
suppose you could manage to take him?”</p>

<p>Then I saw a queer thing happen. Mrs. Fawcette
turned as though she had been stung and glanced first
at me and then at Natalie, with a scarcely veiled
intensity that left us startled in our turn. She did not
answer for a moment, and Natalie was driven into further
speech.</p>

<p>“I’ve been telling him about that wonderful tea we
had there before, and he wants to come along and sample
it. But of course if you’d rather not——” She glanced
from Mrs. Fawcette to me in obvious embarrassment.</p>

<p>I thought Mrs. Fawcette had grown rather pale, but
she answered now and readily enough: “You bad girl!
I told you not to talk about that tea, or our host will be
swamped with people coming to sample it and
demanding where he got it. But if Mr. Clayton wants to come
with us, I shall be delighted to include him in the party.”
She avoided my eyes as she spoke. “He can see you home
afterwards,” she added.</p>

<p>There was an almost venomous light in her eyes as
she spoke. But if Natalie saw it she appeared serenely
unconscious of the fact.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” she answered, “and I’m awfully sorry
if I should not have talked to him about it.”</p>

<p>Naturally I did not feel very comfortable about my
position in the party, but I was determined to go, and
so made no demur to my somewhat left-handed
invitation. And later, when we found ourselves in Mrs.
Fawcette’s car on the way to her friend’s house, she seemed to
wish to make amends by being very cordial to us both.
But I did not much relish the look in her eye when it fell
on Natalie all the same.</p>

<p>Our host was a Russian, an aristocrat and a card from
the fallen house of cards that had been Russia, carried
by the wind of that fall into a new country and a new
circle.</p>

<p>Unlike most Russian aristocrat refugees, however, he
seemed to have plenty of means. The house, just off
Fifth Avenue in the Eighties, was beautifully if
somewhat barbarically furnished, with a queer mixture of
Occidental comfort in the shape of deep lounges and
armchairs, and of Oriental splendor in many and rich
hangings and cushions. The air of his rooms was heavy with
perfume, and the man himself, with his pale skin,
deep-set eyes and pointed beard, gave an impression of
something equally exotic. We were the only guests and he
welcomed us with almost effusive cordiality, myself
included. But I did not take to him at all.</p>

<p>After a few moments of general conversation, Mrs.
Fawcette rose to her feet, smiling. “Droga,” she called
to him—he was talking to Natalie—“I have brought
something to show you. I am sure that the young people will
excuse us for a moment!”</p>

<p>Before I had recovered from my amused surprise at
the somewhat crude method of classifying me with
Natalie, Ivanovitch, our host, had risen to his feet with a
smile and a bow and followed Mrs. Fawcette through a
pair of heavy curtains into a room beyond.</p>

<p>Natalie and I turned and stared at each other. “Well!”
she laughed. Then her smile faded and she touched my
arm. “But I’m glad you came,” she whispered. “I don’t
think I like it here very much; I thought there were going
to be a lot of people. At least, I thought that was what
Mrs. Fawcette said.”</p>

<p>“Natalie, dear,” I whispered, “don’t come here again
without me! Promise!”</p>

<p>I was very much in earnest, and the “dear” slipped
out before I knew it, but fortunately she did not seem
to notice it. “You are growing very dictatorial, sir!”
she answered. “But all the same I don’t believe I do like
it here. I’m glad you came.”</p>

<p>A moment later the curtains parted and the others
rejoined us. There was nothing to be learned from our
host’s expression, for his face was a beautiful blank.
But I thought Mrs. Fawcette bore traces of either
temper or fear, and possibly both.</p>

<p>But that was all that happened. We had tea, and
I must say it was wonderful tea. But it was just tea
and nothing more, of that I am certain. The
conversation was general and interesting enough, and if Natalie
was disappointed she naturally could not show it.</p>

<p>For my part, I went very much out of my way to be
pleasant to the Russian, although not too obviously, I
hope. And presently, after the tea-things had been
cleared away by a slant-eyed servant, I drew him into
a discussion on the war and its ultimate effect upon his
country, while the two women talked clothes or
something. I laid myself out to be both sympathetic and
entertaining. At all events, the moment came when I felt
justified in asking him to give me the pleasure of taking
him to lunch the following day, and he accepted readily
enough. If there was anything to be learned from him
I was determined to make an attempt to learn it. And
I believed that Natalie’s first statement about the tea
was correct. She was exceedingly healthy and not
given to violent moods.</p>

<p>Afterwards, Mrs. Fawcette had to hurry home to dress
for a dinner engagement, and I took Natalie back to her
aunt’s house.</p>

<p>When our taxi pulled up in front of the house it was
nearly dinner-time, and we both had engagements. But
I detained her for a moment longer.</p>

<p>“Listen, Natalie! Will you do me a very big favor?”
I asked her, as we mounted her aunt’s steps.</p>

<p>She threw me a smiling glance of inquiry.</p>

<p>“It is a big favor,” I warned her. “And this is it:
Will you promise to tell me before you go there again
for any more of that wonderful tea?”</p>

<p>Natalie looked at me in wonder. “How funny you
are to-day,” she said at last. “Don’t you like Mrs.
Fawcette or Ivanovitch?”</p>

<p>“Not very much, I confess. But I like the idea of that
drugged tea even less, Natalie. Promise, please!”</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders. “I’ve got to go and
dress, you importunate man,” she laughed, “so—I’ll
promise. Though I haven’t the slightest idea why I
should.”</p>

<p>At all events, I went down her aunt’s front steps
treading on something much less substantial.</p>

<h2>Chapter VIII. <br> Amateur Burglary</h2>

<p>Next morning, which was Thursday, at breakfast,
Larry smashed a cup and saucer, burned his
hand and almost established a reputation for
nerves.</p>

<p>He was giving me my breakfast at the time and had
a cup of hot coffee in his hand. My question was mild
enough, too.</p>

<p>“Larry,” I asked him, “where could I buy a kit of
burglar’s tools?”</p>

<p>Larry stared. “D’ye mean jemmies an’ that, sor?”</p>

<p>“That’s just what I mean!”</p>

<p>Larry stared. “Sure, d’ye think I’d be usin’ them,
thin?”</p>

<p>“On the contrary, Larry,” I told him calmly, “I want
to use them myself. You see, I intend to become a
burglar.”</p>

<p>It was then that Larry dropped the coffee-cup,
burning his hand rather badly.</p>

<p>I waited until he had finished hopping around the
room, and until the really remarkable richness and
variety of his profanity had exhausted itself. Then I told
him a little about my plans for that afternoon.</p>

<p>The night before, after seeing Natalie home, I had
gone to a dinner and theater party, and had not reached
my own flat until the small hours. Nevertheless, I
found Larry waiting up for me, with the news that Moore
wanted to speak to me the moment I came in. I don’t
know how much Larry guessed of our relations and plans,
but he seemed content to obey orders and ask no
questions. And he and Moore were on the best of terms by
now.</p>

<p>Moore answered at once when I rang him.</p>

<p>“Listen, old fellow,” he said. “There’s some really
big news for you. I have had another talk with Vining.
I took him out to dinner last night and gave him a really
good time, and I think he has thawed out at last. At
any rate, he admitted that he could take me to a
wonderful party if he wanted to.</p>

<p>“I had told him,” Moore went on, “that my one object
in life was a new and unique sensation, and of course
when he admitted that he could give me one, I deviled
the life out of him to do it. Well, Clayton, he finally
consented!”</p>

<p>“Great stuff,” I told him.</p>

<p>“I wanted to go to it to-morrow night. But he couldn’t
manage that. He’s going out of town to-morrow.
However, he promised to take me the night after. That’s
Friday night. But I am to be blindfolded, to travel in
a closed car and to pay $200 for the privilege. Pretty
steep, eh?”</p>

<p>“It ought to be <em>some</em> party,” I remarked.</p>

<p>“You’d think so,” Moore continued. “Now I’ve been
thinking the thing over and I can’t believe that a gang
like that will give me the slightest chance to learn where I
am going or how I got there. They couldn’t afford to.
And they’re probably too clever to fool.</p>

<p>“That leaves two other courses open to us. We can
try to find out beforehand approximately where they
are going, and you can pick me up on the way and follow
on. Or you can attempt to follow me from the start.
But if they are the clever rogues I think they are, the
latter will not be easy.”</p>

<p>“Nor the former, for that matter,” I remarked.</p>

<p>“Perhaps not,” Moore replied. “But now that we
know definitely that Vining is mixed up with <em>some</em> gang,
even if it isn’t the one we are looking for, I think we
can take more definite steps to find out more about him.
And he’s to be away to-morrow afternoon.”</p>

<p>“Search his rooms,” I said.</p>

<p>“Exactly,” said Moore. “What do you say?”</p>

<p>“Do you think he’s at all suspicious of you, Moore?”</p>

<p>There was silence for a moment. Then Moore’s voice
came more slowly over the wire. “Damn it, Clayton, I
can’t be sure. Of course he seems perfectly friendly
now. But he did change a bit suddenly. However, that’s
probably only my imagination.” Moore hesitated. “He
certainly wouldn’t loosen up at all at first.”</p>

<p>“Well then, listen. I don’t believe that it’s worth
while your taking a chance of running foul of him.
Did he tell you of his own free will that he was going
out of town to-morrow?”</p>

<p>“Yes, made quite a point of it. But, of course, I was
disappointed at not going to the party sooner.”</p>

<p>“Well, if he’s at all suspicious of you and he’s as
clever as you say he is, maybe he’s counting on your
doing that very thing!”</p>

<p>“What? Searching his rooms? Clayton, you’ve got
a head on you!”</p>

<p>“It’s just possible,” I answered. “So I think it would
be better if I go. Then if I’m caught, he’ll take me for
a burglar and not suspect you necessarily. I’ll take
Larry with me, and if they’re planning to surprise me,
maybe I’ll give them a surprise in return. Besides, if
he does try to ambush me, we’ll know that he is
suspicious of you.”</p>

<p>So Moore agreed to this plan, if rather reluctantly,
and gave me Vining’s address. He told me something
else, too, that strengthened my conviction that it would
be unwise for him to go. He was pretty sure, though
not certain, that he was being followed. We discussed
this rather disturbing news for a while, I told him my
own news and we rang off.</p>

<p>Some of this I explained to Larry. And then and there
Larry made a suggestion which I was convinced would
be of great value to me.</p>

<p>“Sure, sor,” said Larry, “I’d burgle Dublin Castle
itself wid the loikes of yerself. But I hate to burgle a house
where they mebbe know you’re comin’.”</p>

<p>“Can’t be helped, Larry. We’ve got to take that
chance!”</p>

<p>“Well, sor, mebbe we could get away from the loikes
av thim, anyhow. But if this Vining is such a clever
lad, he must be a real dangerous customer, sor?”</p>

<p>“Shouldn’t be surprised, Larry.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, mebbe ’twould do ye no good to get away
from him, if he was to see yer face. Mebbe he’d get ye
in the long last, in any case.”</p>

<p>“That’s another chance we’ve got to take, Larry!”</p>

<p>Larry scratched his head. “Well, sor, in me spare
toime I’ve been dippin’ into some of these detecative
shtories. ’Tis enough to make ye laugh, some av thim
is, but there was one lad, a gintleman cracksman he
called himself, that had some bright ideas. And one av
thim was that he wore a mask.”</p>

<p>“Been keeping in touch, have you, Larry?” I laughed.
“But that’s a damned good idea, all the same. Go to one
of the theatrical make-up stores in the West Forties
this afternoon and get two of them. Then buy a kit of
tools. Then go to Vining’s house and look over the
lay of the land. He lives on the second floor.” And I
told him the address.</p>

<p>“Finally, Larry,” I added, “meet me with your kit at
59th Street and Lexington Avenue at nine o’clock to-night,
and do <em>not</em> bring a gun. If we’re going to have to injure
any one, we’ve got to do it quietly. For we can’t afford
any kind of publicity. That’s all, Larry.”</p>

<p>Natalie and I went for a ride in the Park that
Thursday morning, and for a few hours I forgot my quest.
Perhaps I will be accused of lack of feeling for that. But
I loved and longed for my little sister none the less
because Natalie had come into my life.</p>

<p>Only, I had led a curiously uneventful life, up to that
time, aside from my experiences in the war; my
knowledge of women was limited to social amenities and books;
the light loves of the average young sower of wild oats
had never appealed to me; and so I had to struggle
against a very torrent of dammed-up longing and
emotion now that I had met Natalie.</p>

<p>For I was wildly, hopelessly in love with her. We had
only known each other for some three weeks, I know,
but the thing had come on me like a very flash of
revelation, and was unmistakable and not to be denied.</p>

<p>They say that women are aware of these things. If she
knew that I loved her, she at least did not show it, by
word or look. And, of course, after a friendship of only
three weeks, I had done my best to hide my feelings
until I could give her a chance to “get used to me,” as I
expressed it to myself.</p>

<p>She was very lovely that morning. The sun vied with
the wind in tormenting me by playing hide-and-seek in
her wayward masses of hair. Her beautiful face
radiated health and happiness, so that passers-by turned and
watched her brazenly. And ever the lovely eyes looked
into mine, clear, innocent and friendly, until laughter
and badinage died on my lips and I rode beside her
tongue-tied and almost blind with longing to take her
into my arms, there in the sunlight, and tell her that
she meant the past, the present, the future and all life to
me.</p>

<p>Perhaps she guessed. For she talked on at random
and more rapidly than usual, until I recovered some
show of casual companionship, and presently she told me
that she was tired and asked me to take her home.</p>

<p>But at her door she left me with lowered eyes and
only a faint “Good-by,” so that, for some reason, I left
her house happier than I had ever been in my life.</p>

<p>By the time I had bathed and dressed for my lunch
with Ivanovitch, something of the mood of the morning
had passed and I was back in the spirit of my quest
again.</p>

<p>I called for him in my little car and took him to an
inn out on the Peekskill road. It is a beautiful place,
that inn, and I think the Russian enjoyed himself,
although I could not supply him with anything to match his
wonderful tea. But I’m not so sure that he enjoyed the
drive. He struck me as something of a hothouse product,
and I drive rather fast.</p>

<p>By the time we got there I had schooled myself to
a line of subtly degrading conversation to spring on him,
more in keeping with his tastes, I hoped. It succeeded
better than I expected.</p>

<p>I discovered that the precious Mr. Ivanovitch followed
my lead with extraordinary alacrity. In his subtle and
charming way he gave vent to a series of the nastiest
remarks that I have ever listened to. It would have been
a real pleasure to throw him over the balcony of the inn,
into the gorge some fifty feet below. But I had more than
my personal tastes to consider in that interview.</p>

<p>I did my best to convince him that I shared his views
and his tastes. I took a leaf from Moore’s book, and
admitted that I had run through pretty well the entire
gamut of sensations with the exception of drugs, and that
I was too lazy to go in search of those. Finally, I
admitted quite frankly that I had heard of some wonderful
tea that he had served at his house and begged him to
tell me whether it was really as captivating as it had been
called.</p>

<p>But Ivanovitch was cautious. He told me that I had
had some of that tea the preceding afternoon and that it
was merely good tea.</p>

<p>So I let the matter drop entirely, and talked about
Russia and other general subjects until it was time to
take him home.</p>

<p>At his door, however, I tried once more. “Well,
Monsieur, I have to thank you in turn”—he had expressed
himself as pleased with his entertainment—“for a
delightful luncheon, and I can only hope that you will give me
another opportunity to enjoy your society. You are a
man of the world, Monsieur,” I laughed; “and I hope,
too, that if you run across something new in this weary
round of nights and days, you will let me share it with
you!”</p>

<p>He bowed, smiling his cynical smile. “Who knows,
perhaps I may yet be able to introduce you to a new
sensation, my dear Mr. Clayton.”</p>

<p>And with that we parted.</p>

<p>There had been something about his smile that I did
not entirely like. But I did not like the man at all,
anyway, and I put it down to the fact of his alien
temperament. At all events, if he, too, knew anything about the
famous revels of which we were beginning to learn, I had
made a fair start to learn more through him.</p>

<p>The real event of the day began when I met Larry at
nine o’clock. He was at the appointed place promptly
on time, and I could see by his slightly increased girth
that he had brought the kit of tools with him. I myself
was dressed in my oldest clothes and looked as much like
a burglar as possible, so that if Vining saw me he would
not connect me with Moore or think it more than a
coincidence. With nothing more than a nod and a smile,
Larry jumped into the car and we proceeded to Vining’s
home, parking the car down the street a little way.</p>

<p>The house was one of those high, narrow, brown-stone
fronts in the Sixties. Originally it had had a basement
and steps leading up to the first-floor front door. But,
like many of these houses, it had been converted into
apartments, the steps had been torn down and the
basement entrance was now the front door. The latter was
set in, in a little vestibule, the entrance was overshadowed
by the steps of the house next door, and forcing an
entrance, Larry said, was child’s play if we didn’t get
caught.</p>

<p>Larry had found out through local stores that Vining
lived alone, as a rule, and that his apartment was cared
for by a woman who came in by the day, so that once
we reached his rooms we were in little danger of
detection. But the difficulty was forcing the lock on the front
door without attracting attention.</p>

<p>Vining lived on the second floor. His windows were
dark. But there were lights in the apartment on the
first floor although there were none in the basement, so
that we were in constant danger of detection as we stood
in the little entrance.</p>

<p>However, Larry began fishing under his coat and
calmly made ready to force the lock. I confess that I
was uncomfortable. This was taking the law into our
own hands with a vengeance—and if we were caught, I
could not take the law into my confidence. Then, too,
if any one came along while we were searching Vining’s
rooms and saw the forced lock, there would be a
hullabaloo at once.</p>

<p>“Wait a minute, Larry,” I said, “there are some
children coming. I’ve got a better idea, I think.”</p>

<p>There were letter-boxes for each apartment in the
vestibule and a push button underneath each letterbox.
We stood quietly waiting until the children had come,
laughing and calling, nearly opposite us. Then I pressed
all the bells.</p>

<p>I waited a moment, and then sure enough I heard
the latch lifted. “Quick, Larry,” I whispered. “Slip
something into the door to hold it open.”</p>

<p>He slipped one of his tools under the door at the
bottom, so that the latch could not close again, and then I
drew him back into the shadow of the steps next door.</p>

<p>We waited a few moments and presently we heard a
window raised overhead. The children were still calling
in the street, and a woman’s voice floated down to us,
faintly: “Drat those children!” Then the window was
closed with a bang.</p>

<p>Larry drew closer to me. “Say, have you done this
before, sor?” he demanded.</p>

<p>We waited for perhaps ten minutes, But nothing
happened and no one came to the front door, either from
inside the house or from the street. Then Larry slipped
quietly forward, pushed open the door, picked up his
jemmy and stood waiting for me. “Come on, sor,” he
whispered, “ ’tis now or never!”</p>

<p>I followed him into the house.</p>

<p>Now I had told Larry that there was just a possibility
either that they were waiting for us or that they might
return and catch us. On that account I had arranged
that we should not stick together after we got into the
apartment, but that he should drop behind a little and
follow me. As soon as he was inside, he was to hide
somewhere where he could watch me, to act, if necessary,
as surprise reënforcements. What I had heard of Vining
had made me skeptical as to the ease with which his rooms
could be searched, especially if there were anything there
for him to conceal.</p>

<p>There was a light in the entrance hall, but everything
was quiet. We passed through it and up the first flight
of stairs. My heart was in my mouth. However, the
stairs creaked hardly at all, and we reached the dark hall
one flight up with very little noise.</p>

<p>Larry had called with a parcel for an imaginary tenant
earlier in the evening, and had not only marked in his
memory the stairs that creaked, but had also ascertained
that Vining’s door would be comparatively simple to
open.</p>

<p>As it lessened the chance of people coming in and
catching us, we mounted the second flight at once. We
were almost in darkness, I could see nothing, and the
necessity for speed coupled with the need for making
absolutely no sound had me, at least, keyed up to a
pretty high pitch.</p>

<p>We were half-way up the second flight, on our hands
and knees fortunately, and maneuvering a creaky step,
when a door opened in the hall just below us, letting out
a flood of light. Fortunately it came from a chandelier
high up in the room beyond and did not reach the spot
where we stood. But it was nervous work, standing, or
rather crouching, with one knee in the air, while that
woman put out her light, locked the door and proceeded
down the stairs to the front door.</p>

<p>A moment later we stood in the dim hall in front of
Vining’s door and donned our masks.</p>

<p>I stood and waited while Larry let go of my hand and
stooped down. I heard a little scraping sound, a chink as
of metal striking metal and then a sharp crack, that
sounded as loud as a big gun in the silent hall. We
stood still for a moment, but nothing happened.</p>

<p>“There you are, sor,” came Larry’s cheerful whisper.
“You go ahead and I’ll foller and hide.”</p>

<p>So, with a little electric torch in one hand and the
other held out blindly before me, I crept into the
darkness that was, presumably, Vining’s entrance hall.</p>

<p>After a moment I heard the front door close softly
behind me, and then I ventured to use the torch.</p>

<p>Have you ever gone into a strange house and tried to
make out the lay of the land with a pocket torch? The
torch shows up only one tiny spot at a time, and when
you have swept it all over one article of furniture and
made out its general dimensions, you have forgotten
everything else!</p>

<p>However, I found my way through the tiny hall and
into a room on the left, which appeared to be a
sitting-room. This room was dimly lit with a faint radiance
that filtered in from the street below, and I was able to
make out the distribution of the furniture. One of the
first things I noticed was a desk in the far corner by the
window, and I decided that that was my goal. Larry
was still at my heels.</p>

<p>“Open up that desk, Larry,” I whispered. A moment
later I heard the snap of the lock. “Now follow me while
we search the rest of the place first.” We went back
into the tiny, pitch-dark hall again.</p>

<p>The front door was at right angles to the outside hall.
The little entrance hall was also at right angles to the
outside hall and ended almost at once in an alcove with
a sofa and some chairs in it. But we found that another
and narrower hall, the entrance to which was hidden by
a heavy curtain, passed back inside the flat for its entire
length. The dining-room, kitchen, bathroom and two
bedrooms led off it in turn, and the hall ended in a
window at the back of the house. A third bedroom lay to the
right of the hall at the back. As it was a corner house
all these rooms had windows.</p>

<p>We found nothing, that is, nothing of any importance
to our search. One of the rooms showed evidences of
recent feminine occupancy. But there was no one in the
apartment—that was certain.</p>

<p>A good deal relieved, I returned to the front hall,
stationed Larry in the alcove there, and made my way to
Vining’s desk in the front room.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="ch09">

<h2>Chapter IX. <br> The First Skirmish</h2>

<p>To my disappointment, there was very little in the
desk. A few old letters, an invitation or two,
some receipts and a couple of blank income-tax
return forms were all that my first search revealed. But
having come there with so much difficulty, I was
determined to find it, if there were anything to be found,
and going through the desk more carefully a second time
disclosed something that might be more valuable. It
was a tiny account book; I found it in a little hollow
under the blotter.</p>

<p>I studied it for a moment there in the silence, by the
aid of my little torch, and presently received a shock.
For it was half full of names, and these included several
of the people whom I knew. After each name was a
series of dates, followed by single figures, so that a
single entry read something like this:</p>

<table class="accounts">
<tr><td class="name">Emily Horton:</td><td>August 11—2.</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>August 15—3.</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>August 17—2, etc.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Suddenly there was a tiny sound from the hall
outside, and I instinctively switched off my torch and slipped
the little book into my pocket. I turned toward the
doorway, which lay in shadow. Then I became conscious that
my heart was pounding heavily, for I could see that
something was moving in the shadowy corner.</p>

<p>“Hands up!”</p>

<p>I was blinking in a glare of blinding light, from the
suddenly illuminated chandelier, my hands high above
my head, and staring into the unwavering muzzle of a
large and efficient-looking automatic. The owner of the
gun stood just inside the doorway, with two other men
flanking him on either side—and a very determined and
formidable trio they looked.</p>

<p>In the pause that followed I had time to recognize
Vining, from Moore’s description, as the man with the
gun. I had also time to wonder what had become of my
reënforcements in the shape of Larry. Obviously the
next move was in either his hands or Vining’s, for I was
effectually covered.</p>

<p>“Drop one hand and take off that mask!” Vining
snapped.</p>

<p>I was silent and made no move.</p>

<p>“Won’t, eh?” he snarled. “Don’t forget that I’m
perfectly justified in killing you where you stand. Just a
little pull on this”—he curled his finger suggestively
around the trigger for my benefit—“and you’ll be very
little trouble, my friend. Are you going to take it off?”</p>

<p>The three men were just inside the door. But as
Vining spoke he took a step forward into the room and
toward me, and his companions came forward with him.
The light switch was on the wall, just inside the door,
and as Vining advanced I saw a hand steal through the
doorway and along the wall in the direction of the switch.
Then Larry’s black poll appeared and he beckoned me
with his other hand, but he did not turn the switch at
once.</p>

<p>Vining swore. “—— him! Take that mask off and
search him!” he said to his two satellites, who were
standing, waiting for orders.</p>

<p>I glanced at the two men and wondered. They were
swarthy and foreign, with high cheekbones—distinctly
Slavic. But as they stepped toward me, a great many
things happened at once.</p>

<p>For one thing, Larry came fully into view. He had
a small rug in his hand. He stepped silently as close
as he could to Vining and still reach the switch. Then
at one and the same moment the rug sailed over Vining’s
head, the light went out, my fist connected with one
Slavic jaw, while with my other arm I caught the other
assistant around the middle to act as a shield in case
Vining’s gun went off. And Larry must have caught
Vining from behind, for another loud crash from the
other side of the dark room accompanied the bang with
which my first victim brought up against the floor. I
threw the second Russian down by means of the
cross-buttock, with which simple expedient he did not seem
familiar, judging by the way he literally fell for it. Then
I stumbled over the first Russian and blundered into
Larry in the doorway, and together we fled for the front
door and the outside world, Larry chuckling richly under
his breath.</p>

<p>As we crowded through the front door, there came
the roar of somebody’s revolver from the room behind
us and a scream of pain—and Larry broke into open
laughter.</p>

<p>“Sure, sor,” he panted, as we fled down the last flight,
“they’ll kill each other entirely if we do but lave thim to
ut!”</p>

<p>“Maybe,” I answered, “but they’ll rouse the whole place
about our ears. We’ve got to get out of here—and
quick!”</p>

<p>The headlights of my car were burning faithfully down
the street, and as we hurried toward it, I noticed another,
larger car a little farther down, across the street and
facing the other way. It had not been there when we
came. As we came out from the shadow of the house
next door a figure detached itself from the larger car and
approached us slowly.</p>

<p>“Your mask, Larry,” I warned him, taking off mine at
the same time.</p>

<p>I paid no particular attention to the man from the
other car until he reached us. It was too dark for me
to see his face, and too dark, I hoped, for him to see
mine. For as we met he glanced at us closely and then,
without a word, turned and hurried back to his car.</p>

<p>I caught Larry’s arm. “By gad, that looks like more
of them. Jump in quick!” I told him.</p>

<p>I was in the driving seat with Larry tumbling in
behind me before the stranger reached his own car. But
just as I slipped in the clutch something whistled
between Larry and me, and a section of glass from my
wind-shield leaped into the air and fell on the hood.</p>

<p>“Head down, Larry,” I shouted, as we gathered speed.
Then I looked back.</p>

<p>The other car was drawn across the road, with the
front wheels on the sidewalk, in the act of turning. It
looked enormous in the dim light, and I could see that
it had more than one occupant, though how many I could
not tell. Another bullet whistled over our heads,
perilously close, but there came no sound of an explosion.</p>

<p>“Air-guns again, Larry,” I shouted, above the roar
of my open cut-out. “If we’re to save our skins we’ve
got to shake them.”</p>

<p>Fortunately Park Avenue, when we reached it, was
clear for the moment and we drove across, heading for
Fifth. Larry looked back this time, for I had to watch
the wheel.</p>

<p>“They’re at Park now, sor,” he shouted. “They’re
stuck in the thraffic, I—no, sor, they’re through—and
coming like the wind!” he added.</p>

<p>I was pretty sure of being able to shake them off, for
my little car could do sixty easily, being well engined and
heavily built, and that was as fast as any car would dare
go under any circumstances, in the city, I thought. But
Larry had a better idea.</p>

<p>“Tis a big, long cyar, they have, sor. ’Twill take
them long to turn corners, I’m thinkin’,” he shouted.</p>

<p>By the time we reached Madison Avenue the big car
was about a hundred feet behind us and gaining rapidly.
Again the street was clear luckily, and I swung round
the corner to the right on two wheels. The pursuing car
turned more slowly, as Larry had surmised, and by the
time I turned east again, it was just getting into speed on
Madison Avenue.</p>

<p>I was well down the block toward Park Avenue again
when the long hood swung round the corner of Madison,
and it looked very much as if we could get away by
constantly turning corners.</p>

<p>But we were both of us mad to count on our luck
holding so long, for at Park Avenue I met a phalanx of
three cars abreast, going south, and by the time I was
able to turn south on Park Avenue, the big car was close
behind. Fortunately there was one car between, for our
pursuers again took long in turning.</p>

<p>As it turned into Park behind us, Larry looked back
again. “There’s three of them in the car, sor. Must be
their lucky number.” At all events Larry was always a
cheery companion.</p>

<p>But now I did not dare turn out again, they were too
close. By reckless driving that brought a shout from
more than one other car, I managed to keep my lead and
even to lengthen it by passing another car. But as we
swept up on the viaduct around the Grand Central, the
big car nosed its way back to third place again.</p>

<p>Larry leaned close to me. “Can you make a left-hand
turn, sor?” he asked eagerly. “Can ye get to Third
Avenue?”</p>

<p>“What for?”</p>

<p>“I’ve an idea, sor. I think we can give thim a lesson
if you can get to the L.”</p>

<p>I had no idea what Larry had up his sleeve, and I
had to watch my driving too closely to find out. Besides,
by the time we dipped down to Fourth Avenue again, at
40th Street, the pursuing car had crept still closer, so I
had no chance to turn either way.</p>

<p>The traffic was thinning out, too, and remembering
the recklessness of our pursuers, I felt the skin crawling
on the back of my head, where I expected a better-aimed
bullet almost any moment.</p>

<p>However, either they had grown more cautious or
they had made certain that they could catch us without
difficulty, for as far as I know they did not fire again.</p>

<p>At 34th Street I had a stroke of luck. I got across
just before the traffic cop blew his whistle, and while I
do not suppose that would have stopped our pursuers,
there was another car in between which pulled up and
obliged them to stop to avoid a collision.</p>

<p>The traffic cop called after me, but I was much too
busy to pay attention at the moment. “We’ve beat them,
sor, we’ve beat them. Now where, sor?” cried Larry.</p>

<p>“We’ll twist about a bit, Larry, and try to throw
them off the scent entirely,” I answered.</p>

<p>At 32nd Street I turned west. Then, at Madison,
having plenty of time, I made a left-hand turn, going south
again, as I imagined that they would immediately expect
me to go north.</p>

<p>After that I twisted in and out, gradually working
south until I reached Broadway and Union Square. Here
I turned east, intending to run down to Third Avenue and
so run north, and as I passed Lexington Avenue, a long,
black hood shot out and made for my rear wheels, and it
was only by stepping on the accelerator that I avoided the
nastiest kind of a turnover smash-up. Either our
pursuers were mind-readers or it was the worst of bad
luck.</p>

<p>The other car swung in behind us at once, and in
order to avoid being overtaken then and there, and
probably shot at close quarters, I made a quick right-hand
turn into Third Avenue, ran along beside a street car
and shot in front of it, perilously close to an L pillar.</p>

<p>I intended to make another right-hand turn almost at
once, but Larry had another idea. “Now we’re here, sor,
shtick to the L. Ye can wind in and out until we get to
the Bowery, and then—then Oi’ll finish thim, or me name
ain’t Larry Malloy!”</p>

<p>My own idea was to trust to my luck and try turning
corners again. But Larry seemed so sure of his plan
that I decided to risk it, although, if I had realized its
bloodthirsty nature, I might have hesitated.</p>

<p>The others were held up for a moment or two behind
the street car and before they could catch us again, I
had turned into the broad open sweep of the Bowery, the
scene of my first meeting with Larry.</p>

<p>I slowed up a little and looked back. The pursuing
car was half a block behind and overtaking us rapidly.</p>

<p>“This is as good a place as another, sor,” said Larry
grimly. “Duck yer head as much as ye can and lave
thim catch us. Most like they’ll try to come up
alongside, and that’s what I’m afther.” He was fumbling
with his kit of tools under his coat, and a moment later
I caught the dull flash of light from a heavy, blue-steel
jemmy.</p>

<p>The whole street was deserted before us as the other
car came purring up behind. We were on the car tracks
and doing about thirty-five miles an hour. The other car
must have been doing at least forty-five or fifty.</p>

<p>Sure enough it came up close behind and then nosed
out on to the north-bound car tracks, evidently with the
idea of running up alongside. But as I turned out to the
left, Larry rose suddenly in his seat, turned half round,
and I saw his arm flash back with the jemmy in it. There
came a clatter of glass from the pursuing car, a wild
scream, and then the most horribly roaring crash that I
have ever heard.</p>

<p>I glanced over my shoulder and saw the jemmy fly
true to the wind-shield and through it, just as the car
turned out. It must have caught the driver squarely in
the face, for the car kept straight on its diagonal course.</p>

<p>My last sight of it, looking back, was a huge car, reared
up with its front half-way to the top of a badly buckled
L pillar, its front axle bent almost double, so that wheels
clasped the pillar and a limp body, hanging head
downward, across the hood.</p>

<p>For sheer horror I very nearly pulled up. But people
were hurrying to the crash from all directions, more
than one police whistle was blowing, and Larry was
plucking at my sleeve.</p>

<p>“There,” he said, “that’ll tache ’em a lesson to come
murtherin’ honest citizens!”</p>

<p>But there was an awe in his voice none the less. For
death had come very suddenly to the men behind us
there.</p>

<p>We turned off into a side street presently, and so,
driving slowly and cautiously, made our way home again.
But Larry and I did not talk much on the way back.</p>

<p>I let him put the car away, while I went on to my
rooms alone. To my amazement it was only ten-thirty,
though I felt as though I had lived through a week
at least since I left that afternoon. I was rather shaky.
I had seen death many times in the war, but somehow
the circumstances had been more natural and inevitable
then.</p>

<p>When I reached my sitting-room I sat down in front
of the table to rest a moment before telephoning my
news to Moore. Larry had left a couple of letters where
I could see them, and the sight of one of them set my
thoughts leaping into another channel. I had never
seen her handwriting before, but somehow I knew from
whom that pale blue envelope, addressed in a dainty
sloping hand, had come.</p>

<p>I opened it quickly. It was dated the same day and
must have been written and mailed that morning.</p>

<blockquote class="letter">

  <p class="salutation">“Dear Mr. Clayton,</p>

  <p>“A promise is a promise, in spite of the
  conventions. Mrs. Fawcette is giving a luncheon party for
  me to-morrow (Friday), and has promised that Mr.
  Ivanovitch will be present. Better still, he is to supply
  something very wonderful in the way of a new drink,
  though whether it is to be some more of ‘that wonderful
  tea’ or not I do not know.</p>

  <p>“If you would care to come to ordinary tea at my
  house, or, rather my aunt’s house, to-morrow afternoon,
  about four o’clock, I will tell you all about it, as I
  promised.</p>

  <p class="valediction">“Sincerely yours,</p>
  <p class="signature">“Natalie Van Cleef.”</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I pulled some paper toward me and wrote her a
somewhat longer reply, accepting the invitation. I even
took the risk of begging her in a more or less veiled way
to be careful. When the letter was finished, I took it out
and put it down the hall shute myself. Then I went back
to look at my other letter. But from the events of the
evening to the dainty missive that lay open on my desk
was a gap that brought the former into lurid relief, while
lending them also a touch of unreality. It did not seem
possible, there in my quiet rooms, with that dainty letter
before me, that I had just returned from a flight for my
life that ended in death for some one.</p>

<p>Presently I glanced at the other letter. It was in a
plain envelope and was typewritten.</p>

<p>Here it is:</p>

<blockquote class="letter">

  <p class="salutation">“Dear Clayton,</p>

  <p>“RTIEZQV­LOTKGGD­XGNZETH­LXLDTIZ­ZTSGZZG­FSXYTKQ­ENKTCTW.”</p>

</blockquote>

<p>For a moment I took it for a practical joke. Then I
remembered a simple cipher which Moore had arranged
with the Chief, and I carried the note in to where the
Underwood typewriter stood in my study. First, I took
a sheet of paper and, counting from the first letter of the
keyboard, top row, left, I put down on the paper the
numbers, reading left to right and from the top row down,
which corresponded to the letters.</p>

<p>Thus the first letter, R, was the fourth letter in the first
row. So I put down 4. The next letter, T, was the
fifth letter in the first row, so I put down 5. The next
letter, I, was 8, E was 3, Z was 20, etc.</p>

<p>Reading in this way, I got:</p>

<blockquote>

  <p>4, 5, 8, 3, 20, 1, 23, 19, 9, 5, 18, 15, 15, 13, 21, 15, 25,
  20, 3, 5, 16, 19, 21, 19, 13, 5, 8, 20, 20, 5, 12, 15, 20, 20,
  15, 14, 12, 21, 6, 5, 1, 3, 25, 18, 5, 22, 5, 2.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>By an ordinary alphabetic table, which I had prepared,
with A as 1, B as 2, C as 3, etc., I found that these
numbers represented the following letters:</p>

<blockquote>

  <p>D, E, H, C, T, A, W, S, I, E, R, O, O, M, U, O, Y, T,
  C, E, P, S, U, S, M, E, H, T, T, E, L, O, T, T, O, N, L,
  U, F, E, R, A, C, Y, R, E, V, E, B.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Reading these backward, I got the message:</p>

<blockquote>

  <p>BE­VERY­CAREFUL­NOT­TO­LET­THEM­SUSPECT­YOU­MOORE­IS­WATCHED.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Separated into words:</p>

<blockquote>

  <p>“Be very careful not to let them suspect you. Moore
  is watched.”</p>

</blockquote>

<hr>

<p>When I had finished taking in the full meaning of this
message, which undoubtedly came from the Chief, I
realized, with a new sense of confidence, that the Secret
Service was not only back of us, but keeping closely
in touch.</p>

<p>Then I went to call up Moore. He answered the ’phone
at once, and listened without a word while I told him of
our adventures that night and the finding of the little
book. When I had finished he whistled softly.</p>

<p>“Look here, Clayton,” he said, “this thing is getting
pretty serious. They had a whirl at me to-day. At
least, somebody did their best to run over me twice this
afternoon. I think we had better meet for once, if you
can manage to get to me without being followed and I
can get to you. I think you’d better bring Larry too.
This is what I’ve doped out. You and Larry take a
taxi and drive slowly through the Park from 59th Street
and Fifth Avenue toward the 72nd Street gate, West Side.
On the way you’ll stop and pick me up on an open space,
if I am walking bareheaded. If not, do not stop, even if
you see me. If I do not turn up or if my hat is on, it
will mean that I have been followed, so don’t worry. But
I think I can shake them off in the open. Will you do
that?”</p>

<p>“Of course I will,” I told him. “What time?”</p>

<p>“About 2.30. Then, if we don’t meet, come back
to your rooms and call me at about four. I’ll be
waiting.”</p>

<p>“All right, Moore, old man. I’ll do that.
Good-night!”</p>

<p>“Good-night.”</p>

<p>So we rang off, and after slipping Vining’s little
notebook under the blotter on my table, I went to bed, telling
Larry to see that our front door was locked and the chain
was up. But I did not get to sleep very quickly.</p>

</div>

<hr class="x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter" id="ch10">

<h2>Chapter X. <br> Mrs. Fawcette is Indiscreet</h2>

<p>The next morning, Friday, I woke and lay for a
moment drowsily wondering as to the cause of a
sort of vague excitement of which I was
conscious. Then recollection of the events of the previous
evening returned, and I jumped out of bed and yelled for
Larry and my bath. Although it went against the grain
with me, at first, Larry had quietly but firmly taken to
himself the duties of valet, housemaid, cook and butler.
As a general factotum he was a marvel of usefulness, but
at first I had objected violently to being waited on hand
and foot. Larry, however, had taken these rebuffs quite
calmly and had gone his own sweet way, looking after
my clothes, running my bath-water and bringing me tea
in bed in the morning, and I had gradually drifted into
this sort of a sybaritic existence through sheer laziness.
Once or twice he had even tried to help me on with my
clothes, but I had to draw the line somewhere, and he
finally gave that up.</p>

<p>Larry came in grinning as usual. He had a small
tray in his hand, with a cup of tea and some bread and
butter on it. For a short time in his early career he
had been valet to an Irish lordling, and old habits stuck,
it seemed.</p>

<p>“Take that tea away, Larry,” I told him. “Is my
bath ready? And what the hell do you mean by letting
me sleep so late, you Irish billygoat? What time is it?”</p>

<p>Larry’s face fell, not at the name I called him—he
was used to that—but at the fate of the tea. But he
set the tray down beside the bed.</p>

<p>“Sure, sor, ’tis just gone eight an’ yer bath’s waiting
for ye. Do but take a drop of the tay, an’——”</p>

<p>I reached for a book and Larry promptly dodged,
grinning. “Why didn’t you wake me?” I demanded
again.</p>

<p>“An’ why would I do that same, sor? Sure, if ’twasn’t
wishful to be disturbed ye was, ’tis the whole library
would ’ave come me way.”</p>

<p>“Well, you unmitigated scoundrel, I want breakfast
in ten minutes, or you’ll answer for it,” I told him. “And
after that I want to talk to you, so don’t go sneaking
away to talk to your little lady friend on the next
floor.”</p>

<p>This, as I expected, was a bolt from the blue for Larry,
because I believe he had no idea that I knew of his
growing attachment and increasing encounters with a pretty
little English maid from the flat above. At any rate he
grinned sheepishly and withdrew, taking the tea with
him. For once, a retort of any kind was lacking.</p>

<p>I stripped and plunged into a cold tub, and in fifteen
minutes was seated at one of Larry’s inimitable
breakfasts, wondering what I should do without him, if
anything should come of his attachment to the girl upstairs.
Moore had ways of his own of finding things out, and he
had told me of Larry’s conversations on the stairs. One
of Moore’s maxims was: “Where there’s a woman, there’s
trouble.” But neither of us took Larry’s attachment very
seriously; there had been too many of them. Moore only
feared that he might become too expansive concerning our
affairs. But that I never even considered. You must
trust somebody, and Larry had shown himself entirely
trustworthy.</p>

<p>He stood by until I had taken the edge from my
appetite, and then I turned upon him. “Now then, Larry,” I
said briskly, “pull up a chair and sit down. We’ve got
some plans this afternoon that you’re in on, and I can’t
have you making a mess of them.”</p>

<p>Larry grunted. “Twas something else I made a mess
of last night, sor,” he remarked. “An’ small thanks I
get——”</p>

<p>“Sit down!” I roared. “And shut up!”</p>

<p>Larry sank into a seat, grinning feebly.</p>

<p>“Now,” I began, after a moment, “you and Moore
and I are to have a council of war this afternoon. I’ll
tell you this much, Larry. Moore is being followed and
we’ve got to be careful. His idea is that he should walk
through the Park, and that you and I should take a taxi
and pick him up in some open space, where his shadow
can’t get close to him. What do you think of the plan?
You see, they don’t suspect me as yet.”</p>

<p>Larry pricked up his ears at this. “Who’s ‘they,’ sor?”
he demanded. “Was it that pasty lad with the gun last
night?”</p>

<p>“He and his friends, Larry—and a lot of friends he
seems to have. But I think, Larry—<em>I hope</em>—that they
may know something about my sister.”</p>

<p>“By gorry, sor, gimme the address again—but sure,
don’t I know it?—and I’ll have the heart out av him,
’Tis meself will wring the truth out av the dog, if I
have to sthrangle him.”</p>

<p>I held up my hand. “Wait a bit, Larry. Do you
suppose, if that would do any good, I wouldn’t have
done it long ago? The trouble is he may know nothing.
Besides, it’s a far bigger thing than just one man, and
it’s the whole concern we’re up against. Now I’ve told
you more than I should, and if you breathe a word to
any one of this, my goose is cooked. Get that well in
your thick head right now. Not one single word, Larry!”</p>

<p>“Sure, I know well how to hold me tongue, if that’s
all,” he said.</p>

<p>“Right!” I answered. “Now, what do you think of the
plan?”</p>

<p>Larry thought for a moment. “Tis well enough,
sor,” he answered presently. “But if they see him get
in our taxi they’ll likely have a cyar handy and follow.”
He was silent again, the effort of thought wrinkling an
ordinarily smooth brow. “But I had a pal for a while,
sor. He is living at the country’s expense at the moment,
sor. But we used to meet on the quiet in the Park. He
was being followed and I wasn’t. So he would go for a
walk through the open part, to be sure he was alone, and
then make for that bunch av trees an’ bushes round about
the little resteront near Sivinty-second Street and Fifth
Avenoo. I was waiting there with a closed taxi, and away
we wint before ye cud say knife.” He paused. “Maybe
that wud be better, sor?”</p>

<p>“Good idea, Larry. I’ll call up Moore as soon as I’ve
finished. Now bring me the paper. I’m going out this
morning, but I’ll be back for lunch at one, and we’ll
start right after lunch. We’re to meet him at 2.30.
That’s all, Larry.”</p>

<p>Larry picked up the paper and laid it beside me.
“There it is, sor,” he remarked dryly, pointing to the
third column.</p>

<p>This is what I read:</p>

  <p class="headline">ANOTHER FATAL MOTOR SMASH</p>

  <p class="subheadline">Mystery Car collides with L Pillar <br>
  and two are killed</p>

  <p>“The Bowery last night was the scene of another fatal
  motor-car smash-up, due, apparently, to the usual
  cause—reckless driving. A large touring-car, going probably at
  about sixty miles an hour, collided with an L Pillar.
  Two men were thrown out and instantly killed.</p>

  <p>“Some mystery attaches to the case. No eye-witness
  of the accident can be found. But Joe Cschlenzki, a
  news-vendor, states that the car passed him a moment
  before the crash, going like the wind.</p>

  <p>“There were three occupants of the car at the time
  of the accident. All three were men. The driver escaped
  death, probably by bringing up against the
  steering-wheel. He was unconscious when found, and was
  seriously hurt, being badly cut about the face, and probably
  suffering from internal injuries.</p>

  <p>“The impact must have been terrific, both from the
  noise and from the fact that the big car had climbed
  half-way up the pillar and hung at an angle of 45
  degrees.</p>

  <p>“But the accident presents still more curious features.
  Strangely enough, the car bore New York number plates,
  but investigation by the police showed that the
  corresponding license had been issued to John Havenbier, of
  Yonkers, whose car, a different type, is quite intact.</p>

  <p>“When this fact was discovered, the police tried at
  once to get in touch with the sole survivor of the
  accident. But here again they were baffled. At the time of
  the accident, and before the ambulance arrived, a
  passing car, a large closed limousine, drove by and offered to
  rush the injured man to the Manhattan Hospital. The
  offer was accepted by the police and the man was lifted
  into the car. But later inquiry at the hospital showed
  that no one was admitted to that hospital last night. The
  police have inquired at all the other hospitals also, but
  without result. Apparently the third victim has
  disappeared completely. The police did not take the number
  of the second car, and none of the bystanders appear to
  have noticed it.</p>

  <p>“The bodies of the other two occupants furnished no
  clew as to their identity, as their clothes contained no
  papers of any kind. There were no marks on the
  clothing.</p>

  <p>“Owing to the unusual nature of the accident and the
  mystery surrounding the wrecked car and its occupants,
  the police suspect foul play. It is believed that the fatal
  smash may have been due to a struggle going on in the
  car itself at the time of the accident. An inquest will be
  held this afternoon.”</p>

</blockquote>

<p>That was all. I looked up to find Larry gazing at me
in his droll, half-apologetic way. “What d’ye think of
ut, sor?” he asked.</p>

<p>I thought a moment. “Larry, I think it’s bad,” I told
him. “I never thought any of them would survive a
smash like that, did you?”</p>

<p>“Oi did not, sor.” Larry shook his head.</p>

<p>“Well, one of them has, Larry. And he is probably
back with his friends by now. Vining knows where,
most likely. What’s more, he probably knows our license
number. Good-night! Maybe we’d better move, and
get rid of the car too. But it’s too late for that. They
could trace me easily enough. The license is registered.”
I was thinking aloud.</p>

<p>“Tis doubtful if they was getting near enough for
the loike av that, sor,” Larry observed. “An’ if he did
see it, loikely the smash druv it out av his head.”</p>

<p>“Maybe, Larry; I hope so, anyhow. Well, you’d
better stick around here this morning. Don’t let
anybody in. And if any one calls and asks questions, you
don’t know a thing, but call Moore and get his
instructions after they’ve gone. He’ll be in all morning.”</p>

<p>With that I left the table and went to call Moore
myself. I told him of Larry’s suggestion about our
meeting, and he approved of it at once. We arranged to pick
him up at 2.30 outside the Park Casino near 72nd Street.
Then I rang off. Time enough to talk to him about the
escape of one of our victims when I saw him.</p>

<p>I had promised to take Mrs. Furneau for a drive that
morning. We started about ten. She was in a frivolous
and entertaining mood, and told me that she had
informed Mrs. Fawcette of her engagement to drive with
me. I thoroughly enjoyed the drive, and it was after
twelve o’clock when I reached my apartment again.
To my surprise, my latch-key was not in the usual
pocket, and after a short search I rang the bell,
fuming.</p>

<p>To my amazement, however, no one came.</p>

<p>I was furious. I had distinctly told Larry to stay
home that morning and it seemed that he had disobeyed
orders.</p>

<p>I waited a few moments, ringing again at intervals,
in the thought that he might be washing up and have
his hands full. But after about five minutes I went
back and rang for the elevator, to question the operator,
idly running through my pockets as I waited.</p>

<p>Almost at the same moment that the elevator reached
my floor, my fingers closed on my latch-key, in my vest
pocket. How it got there I have no idea.</p>

<p>“Did my man go out?” I asked the boy. “There does
not seem to be any one there.”</p>

<p>“No, sir, not that I know of. Haven’t you got your
key?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I just found it,” I told him. “Has any one
been here for me?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“Have you been running the elevator all morning?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“All right. Sorry to have bothered you.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right, sir.” The door slammed and the
elevator went down again.</p>

<p>I turned back to my front door and fitted the key
in the lock.</p>

<p>I was vaguely uneasy, and it was that, perhaps, that
caused me to open the door very softly, close it again
as softly and stand listening a moment. There was no
sound in the place, but after a moment or two I became
aware of the fact that there were faint traces of a
lingering perfume in the air, a scent highly feminine and vaguely
familiar. What on earth could it mean? I wondered.
For, so far as I knew, no woman had crossed my threshold
since I took the apartment. Perhaps Larry——</p>

<p>I walked down the hall and into my living-room.
It seemed to me, as I advanced, that there were sounds
of hasty movement just before I reached it. But at first
glance the room seemed to be unoccupied and nothing
appeared to be disturbed.</p>

<p>Then I looked again more carefully, and I noticed
that the curtain in front of my window was swaying
slightly, although the window was closed. It was exactly
the same curtain, incidentally, behind which my earlier
visitor—and Moore’s victim—had hidden himself. The
scent of perfume was stronger here, however, and I was
pretty sure that the curtain concealed a woman this time.</p>

<p>I began to whistle suddenly and strode into the room.
I picked up some papers on the table and flung them down
again. Then I broke into speech: “Confound that boy,
anyway,” I muttered.</p>

<p>After a moment I left the room and tramped down
the hall to Larry’s room. There was no sign of him
anywhere. I found his revolver, ready loaded, slipped it into
my pocket, tramped down the hall, opened the front door
again and slammed it—from the inside. Then I tiptoed
silently back to the living-room door, keeping out of
sight, and waited. I felt that it was as important to find
out what my unconventional visitor wanted there as to
find out her identity. But what had become of Larry
puzzled me more. It was so unlike him to disobey
orders.</p>

<p>For perhaps five minutes there was absolute silence
in the room outside of which I stood. Then at last I
heard a faint rustle and the swish of skirts. This was
followed by the crackle of papers. I stepped into the
doorway, revolver in hand. A woman it was. She
had her back to me and was bending over my table,
running through the papers and letters on it with quick,
nervous fingers. Suddenly she turned her head a little
and I started and slipped the revolver into my pocket.
My unconventional visitor was Mrs. Fawcette.</p>

<p>The blood rushed to my head. It was too much of
a coincidence. It was to Mrs. Fawcette’s house that
Margaret had gone that terrible day. It was Mrs. Fawcette’s
friend that served drugged tea to—I winced—beautiful
young visitors. It was common knowledge that the
woman herself took drugs, though no one knew exactly
what. And now she was here, searching my rooms.</p>

<p>For a moment I wondered whether I could startle
her and perhaps frighten the truth out of her. But I
decided that she was far too clever a woman for that.
Besides, the whole thing was too big, and it would be
better for our search if I could disarm her obvious
suspicion instead. I leaned against the doorpost and coughed
quietly. I could at least hear what she had to say.</p>

<p>My visitor whirled about with a suppressed scream,
her face as white as chalk and her eyes black and wide
with terror. “You!” she cried.</p>

<p>“My dear Mrs. Fawcette,” I answered, bowing. “This
is awfully sweet of you. But I’m afraid that it is a little
indiscreet.”</p>

<p>One hand flew to her heart and she leaned back against
the table. For a moment I thought that she was going
to collapse. But she conquered her momentary
faintness and forced something approaching a smile.</p>

<p>“You frightened me so,” she gasped. “When—when
did you come back?”</p>

<p>“Just now,” I answered. “I’m terribly sorry if I
frightened you. But I was so surprised to see you, you
know. And what in the world has become of my man?”</p>

<p>She hesitated and glanced around the room wildly for
an instant as though searching for a chance to escape.</p>

<p>“I—I don’t know. I found the front door was open
and I came in to find you. But there was no one here at
all.”</p>

<p>“I see,” I answered gently. “Now won’t you sit down
and tell me what I can do for you? Surely we’re too old
friends for you to be so frightened now?” I paused.
“Can I get you a drink?”</p>

<p>“Oh, would you?” She raised a trembling hand to her
mouth and her eyes searched my face. “It’s not the
fright you gave me,” she ventured at last, in a low tone,
“it’s the—way you found me.”</p>

<p>As I stepped to the decanter and poured her out a
stiffish drink of whisky I reflected that this was coming
to the point with a vengeance. The woman certainly had
nerve and wits, for all her fright. I wondered what sort
of a tale she could possibly give me. But she was equal
to the occasion.</p>

<p>“Well, what about the way I found you?” I smiled,
as I handed her the drink.</p>

<p>She drained the whisky at a gulp, and some of the
color came back to her face. I took her arm and helped
her to a chair, and although she hesitated for an instant
and drew back, she sank into it finally and seemed
grateful. The interview promised to be interesting.</p>

<p>“You see,” she answered, “it’s an old story, really,
and one of which I am terribly ashamed. That is why
you startled me so.”</p>

<p>“Don’t tell me if you’d rather not,” I answered gently.</p>

<p>“Oh, but I must,” she insisted. “I must make you
understand or I don’t know what you will think. You
see, when I was a young girl I was very nervous. It is
a failing that takes strange forms sometimes, as you
probably know. With me it took the form of wanting
to—wanting to—take—other people’s
things—sometimes.” She dropped her eyes.</p>

<p>“Kleptomania?” I ventured.</p>

<p>She nodded. “I thought I had conquered it entirely,”
she went on. “But finding myself alone, in here—the
apartment so silent—and—and everything—brought it
back, I’m afraid. So you found me picking over the things
on your desk, hardly knowing what I did. But—I didn’t
take anything!” she concluded piteously.</p>

<p>“My dear lady,” I answered heartily, “I don’t care
whether you did or not. You’re welcome to anything
there is there,” I finished, laughing.</p>

<p>She drew a long breath at that, looking at me closely
the while, however. “Oh—you are—good to me!” she
breathed. “But I knew that you would be.” She rose
slowly to her feet and looked up into my face. “May
I—may I go—now?” she finished pathetically.</p>

<p>“But of course,” I answered, “if you must. But why
go so soon? You haven’t told me why you came yet.”</p>

<p>She walked slowly toward the door into the hall, and
I followed a step or so behind her. But she did not
answer until she had reached the front door and I had
opened it for her. Her head was bent. “Can’t you
guess?” she murmured.</p>

<p>I took her hand gently and pressed it. “Then you
must not go,” I urged. “Come back!”</p>

<p>But she drew her hand away. “No, not now. You
frightened me. I——”</p>

<p>“Some other time perhaps?” I ventured.</p>

<p>She rang for the elevator. We stood together in silence
waiting for it. But just before the car reached my floor
she looked up into my face. “Perhaps!” she
murmured.</p>

<p>If it was acting, like the rest, the glow in her eyes was
the most consummate part of the whole performance.</p>

<p>But the elevator door slammed and I returned to my
empty rooms to sit down and cogitate, while my visitor
presumably repaired to her luncheon with Natalie and
Ivanovitch.</p>

<p>My papers had been disturbed, but I could not find
that anything except a little card-case with a few calling
cards in it—and I might have mislaid that—was missing.
However, her visit was serious enough, if she were
connected with the gang, as it showed that I was at last
suspected. In my anxiety over Larry, however, I forgot
Vining’s note-book and did not look to see whether it was
still there. And events followed each other so rapidly
after that, that I did not think of the little book again
until several days later.</p>

<p>I had been sitting thinking for some ten minutes
perhaps, when the front door slammed again, and in a
moment Larry burst in, grimy, disheveled and wild of
eye. “Thank God,” he cried as soon as he saw me. “I
guessed it was a frame-up, sor, and I thought, maybe,
they’d done for ye, sor, with me not here to look
after—that is, I——”</p>

<p>“What happened, Larry?” I answered sharply. “Out
with it. I’m all right.”</p>

<p>“There wuz a woman, sor,” he stammered, looking
comically indignant. “She come to the door and rang the
bell, and when I answered she grabbed my sleeve and
says, ‘Oh, come wid me. Please, come wid me! I think
some one is being hurt!’ ”</p>

<p>His imitation of an agitated woman was supremely
funny, but it was too serious a matter for laughter. “Go
on,” I nodded.</p>

<p>“Before I knew where I was at, sor, I was down two
flights of stairs wid her, in frunt av that empty flat below
there. She had the key of the door and I follered her in
widout a thought. ‘Why, ’tis impty,’ says she. ‘So it is,’
says I. ‘What do we do next?’ ”</p>

<p>Larry paused. “Then she grabs me arm again. ‘I
know I heard some one scream in here,’ says she. ‘Won’t
you hilp me search the place?’ She was a grand,
handsome woman, sor, beautifully dressed, and I thought
no harm at all. ‘That I will,’ says I, and we set out
together, she clinging on to my arm. The place was as
empty as me hand, sor, and thick wid dust. ‘There’s no
feetmarks,’ says I, wondering. ‘There is not, then,’ says
she. ‘But ’twas in here I heard it, I’m sure of that.’</p>

<p>“Presently she opens a door,” Larry went on. “ ’Twas
all dark inside, sor. ‘Phwat’s in there?’ says she. ‘I
don’t know,’ says I, holding back. ‘Well thin, go an’
see,’ says she, an’ I went, sor!”</p>

<p>Larry paused indignantly, and I stifled my growing
desire to laugh, with difficulty. “Well?” I demanded.</p>

<p>“Sure, sor, no sooner was I inside than she shut the
door on me. An’ it was black as yer hat. ‘Phwat’s that
for?’ I asked her. But she didn’t answer and I felt for
the knob, sor; the door was locked!”</p>

<p>At this I broke into shouts of laughter. And the
hurt, indignant look on his face set me off again worse
than ever every time I tried to collect myself.</p>

<p>“Well?” I asked him at last.</p>

<p>“Sure, sor, I called to her. ‘Let me out!’ I says. ‘Get
out yerself!’ she says and laughed at me. Then I heard
her running down the hall, and next minute the outside
door shut.”</p>

<p>“Well, Larry,” I gasped, between spasms of laughter,
“you <em>are</em> an easy mark! How did you get out finally?”</p>

<p>“Bruk out a panel at last and shot the bolt back. But
it was hot work in that closet. What do you suppose
she wanted, sor?”</p>

<p>“Did you leave the door open—our front door—when
you started out with her?” I asked him.</p>

<p>Larry scratched his head and suddenly he pulled a
long face. “Now I come to think av ut, I belave I did,
sor.”</p>

<p>“I believe you did too, Larry,” I laughed.</p>

<p>“Has she been in here, sor?” he asked more anxiously,
glancing about the room.</p>

<p>“She has that!” I told him.</p>

<p>For once Larry was completely crestfallen. “Faith,
sor, I’ll never belave a woman again!” he said.</p>

<h2>Chapter XI. <br> Black Friday</h2>

<p>I sent Larry to get some lunch ready, and in the
interval went over my papers again to be sure that
nothing else was missing. I had nothing that could
possibly involve me in the eyes of the gang, as I had
long since destroyed the Chief’s letter and I decided
that Mrs. Fawcette’s visit must have been entirely
fruitless. But a vague uneasiness sent me on a further search
for the card-case, and when Larry arrived with the lunch
I questioned him about it.</p>

<p>“Twas there yesterday, sor. Maybe ye wud have
slipped it into a pocket, the way ye wud be lavin’ a cyard
on wan av thim ladies, sor. For ’tis not here now.”</p>

<p>“I can see it isn’t, thank you very much,” I told him,
“And it’s not in a pocket either, I’ve looked.”</p>

<p>Larry grinned. Then, as he circled the table, his
stubby hands full of dishes, his eyes lost their sparkle
and his face settled into painful lines of thought.</p>

<p>“Sor,” said he, “what way did that—lady—know I
was by mesilf here this morning? Was she a friend av
yer honor?”</p>

<p>“She was, Larry. That is to say, an acquaintance.”</p>

<p>“Well, what way she did know I was by mesilf——”</p>

<p>“Good Lord, how do I know, Larry? No, wait a
minute. Yes, I do know. Mrs. Furneau told her, Larry.
Why?”</p>

<p>“I wondered was she spyin’ on ye, sor. That’s all.”
A look of comical indignation swept over his face again.
“But she’s a dangerous woman, sor,” he told me
earnestly.</p>

<p>I laughed. “All women are dangerous to you, Larry.
But you’re perfectly right. Never mind, though. There’s
no harm done.”</p>

<p>“I’m not so sure about that, sor,” said Larry.</p>

<p>What with listening to Larry’s views on women in
general and Mrs. Fawcette in particular, while I ate
lunch, it was nearly two o’clock before I had finished.
Larry consumed a little more time, clearing the table,
and with one thing and another, we did not leave the
apartment until well after two.</p>

<p>We decided to leave the little car in the garage and
take a taxi instead. We found one without difficulty,
and at two-thirty we were in the park and on our way
to the 72nd Street Gate. As we approached the Park
Restaurant there, Larry stuck his head cautiously out
of the window, as being less likely to be recognized
than I. A moment later he was pounding on the glass to
attract the driver’s attention.</p>

<p>The taxi drew up, Larry flung the door open, and in
a moment Moore and I had gripped hands again. The
pleasure of that handshake brought home to me the fact
that I had missed him badly of late.</p>

<p>Larry told the driver to take us around the Park a
couple of times and, as we picked up speed again, Moore
gripped my arm.</p>

<p>“Gad, it’s good to see you again, Clayton,” he cried,
“but I have not time to tell how good, old man. For I’m
hoping big things of to-night. I believe this is our chance
to round up the lot of them. And we’ve a lot to talk over
first.”</p>

<p>I nodded. “Go ahead then,” I told him.</p>

<p>“All right. First, about to-night then. Vining is
coming for me at seven. I thought at first of letting Captain
Peters in on the whole thing. But he’d want to have a lot
of plain-clothes men around here, easily recognized as
detectives. And Vining is nobody’s fool. Of course he
may suspect me. His turning up like that and catching
you in his house looks like it. But that might be a
coincidence, or he might have one of his faithful henchmen
watching his house—it’s quite on the cards when a man
plays the sort of a game he seems to be playing—and the
watcher may have seen you and Larry go in and sent for
Vining. At any rate, there’s nothing but coincidence to
connect me with you or your search of his house. And
his suspicion is a chance we’ve got to take.”</p>

<p>“Pretty desperate position for you if he does suspect
you,” I pointed out.</p>

<p>Moore laughed. “No worse than lots of others we’ll
have to take in this business. It’s all part of the game.
But here’s my idea. The thing we want to accomplish
to-night is to discover the location of this hang-out,
where they give these parties. If we do that, we can
round up the gang at our leisure afterwards. I’ll be
blindfolded and probably won’t have the faintest idea where
they’re taking me. So I want to know whether you’ll
follow and find out where they do take me. Of course
it’s a bit risky——”</p>

<p>“Sure,” I answered, in Larry’s best colloquial style,
“I’m running a helluva lot of risk following you, after
you’ve poked your head into the lion’s mouth like
that.”</p>

<p>“Well, then,” Moore went on, “Vining’s coming at
seven, and I think you ought to be hanging around in
the neighborhood by six-thirty at the latest, in case he
comes a little early. You ought to have a high-powered
car—rent one if necessary—and have it well out of sight.
I’ll try to keep Vining for a moment or two—give him
a drink or something—and that’ll give you time to get
ready after you see him. Better get a good driver or
drive yourself.”</p>

<p>“That’s easily fixed. Larry can see to the car this
afternoon.”</p>

<p>“Good. Now here’s another thing. I’ll tell you frankly
that I’m afraid of Vining. He’s a gifted criminal, and
I’m not at all sure that he’s not playing with us.
Anyhow, I thought it best to tell him about my diggings near
you. I told him that they were usually occupied by a
little lady friend, now on tour, and suggested that he call
for me there, as I would be in that neighborhood. I did
that for this reason. I thought that if anything went
wrong at the last minute, I could get Larry here on the
telephone, and he could get in touch with you at once, as
you’ll be just around the corner waiting with your car.
Then you could come in and we could capture Vining
anyhow, if it came to that. We might be able to get some
information out of him. I know enough about him to
hold him all right.”</p>

<p>“That means that you stay in from six o’clock on,
Larry,” I observed, “no matter how many ladies in
distress come to the door.”</p>

<p>Larry squirmed and Moore looked at me inquiringly.
“What’s all that?” he demanded.</p>

<p>So, with a keen enjoyment of Larry’s speaking
countenance, I told Moore the story of Mrs. Fawcette’s
unconventional visit, winding up with the news of the
luncheon that day given for Natalie.</p>

<p>Moore was silent for a while after I had finished my
yarn, and the gravity of his expression made me vaguely
uneasy. “What do you think of it?” I demanded at
last.</p>

<p>“Clayton, I think it’s bad,” he answered, finally. “In
the first place, I hate the thought of that girl trailing
with that bunch, especially after what you have told me
about her”—he gave me a fleeting grin—“but the Mrs.
Fawcette proposition is worse—I mean, searching your
place. It looks as if they know all about us.”</p>

<p>“Well, if Mrs. Fawcette is in the gang, along with
Ivanovitch and Vining and these others we’ve run across,
why, it would be easy enough for them to trace me through
my car license number, supposing that bloodthirsty
driver of theirs got the number and was well enough,
after the smash, to tell his rescuers about it.” I broke
off and stared at Moore in amazement. “Then they
could trace me and send Mrs. Fawcette to search my
rooms. But, great Scott, that’s too much of a
coincidence, Moore. We’ve got nothing to connect Mrs.
Fawcette and Ivanovitch with Vining; not a thing. They
don’t even belong to the same stratum of society.”</p>

<p>Moore shrugged his shoulders. “Well, as far as that
goes, it doesn’t really affect the main issue much.
To-night’s the night, and we’ve got to locate that gang. It’s
too late to turn back now anyway, even if we wanted
to—which I don’t. How about it?”</p>

<p>“I’m with you, of course,” I answered. “But I hate
letting you get into the hands of that bunch all alone.”</p>

<p>Moore laughed. “It’s got to be done, Clayton. I’ll
be all right. I’ll be talking to you bright and early
to-morrow, most likely with a splitting headache. In the
meantime, I think you’d better trail me until we get to
our destination, wherever that is, hang around a bit, to
be sure that we haven’t stopped for a moment only and
gone on again, and when you’re satisfied that you’ve
found the place, beat it back here again and lie low until
I get back. Then we’ll get in touch with Captain Peters
and round ’em up with his help. How does that strike
you?”</p>

<p>“All right,” I answered. “But I still don’t like your
going alone.”</p>

<p>“Jealous, eh?” answered Moore. “Well, I guess it’ll be
some party!” And we all laughed.</p>

<p>The rest of that jouncing taxi ride was passed in
conjectures and a few final arrangements for that night. I
told Moore about the little book which I had found in
Vining’s desk. I had intended to bring it with me and
show it to him. I had left it on my table for that
purpose. But I had not noticed it and had forgotten it in
the excitement of Mrs. Fawcette’s visit! We left Moore,
finally, at the Plaza, and when we had shaken hands and
he had turned away, my last sight of him was a view of
his well-groomed back, slipping girlishly through the
revolving doors. He never forgot his pose for a moment,
except when he was alone with us.</p>

<p>I dismissed the taxi a few blocks from the house of
Natalie’s aunt, after dropping Larry with instructions to
hire the car. Then, as it was getting on for four o’clock,
I set out to walk to my appointment for tea with Natalie.
On the way I kept a careful look-out for pursuit. But
after turning several corners I was convinced that no one
was following me.</p>

<p>The sight of the house was enough to set my heart
pounding, and I bounded up the steps and rang the bell
with my mind suddenly flooded with delight at the thought
of seeing her. But I was in for a disappointment.</p>

<p>“Miss Van Cleef has not yet returned, sir,” the butler
told me. “But I believe that Mrs. Trevor is at ’ome.
I’ll go and inquire, sir, if you’ll come in.”</p>

<p>Yes, Mrs. Trevor was at home. I waited about five
peaceful minutes and then Natalie’s aunt, like a
full-rigged ship in a heavy sea, came rolling and plunging into
her drawing-room and joined action.</p>

<p>She was a busy fighter too. Heavy broadsides on the
subject of the latest dance, the latest book or the latest
play thundered about my ears, interspersed with a lighter
but more galling fire of social chit-chat and personal
questions from the fighting tops, I was not particularly
worried at first, because her aim was poor, and in my
anticipative state of mind most of her shots went wide.
Besides, I knew that the arrival of reënforcements in the
shape of Natalie would put her to rout. That was one
of the rules of warfare.</p>

<p>But as time passed and Natalie did not come I began
to get restive. Finally, I sadly upset the enemy’s morale
by letting her catch me looking at the clock on the
mantelpiece. It was ten minutes to five!</p>

<p>I turned back to my hostess and stared at her. Natalie
had never been more than ten minutes late for an
appointment. Now she was nearly an hour late—and at her
own house. As I stared at Mrs. Trevor, my heart went
down—down—and my mind whirled into a seething rout
of terrible anxiety. I must have turned white, for my
hostess’s social manner fell away from her like a garment
and the human woman in her stood forth.</p>

<p>“Mr. Clayton! What’s the matter? Are you ill?
Tell me!”</p>

<p>I pulled myself together as well as I could. “No, no,
I’m all right, Mrs. Trevor. I’m all right. Just a stitch
or something. But I wonder what has become of Miss
Van Cleef? She was to be home at four o’clock. Do you
know whether she was going on anywhere ease after the
luncheon at Mrs. Fawcette’s?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Trevor stared at me, the shadow of a smile about
her mouth. “Why, no, I don’t think so. I’m sure she
wasn’t. I’ve been wondering myself what can have
become of her. But I dare say she’ll turn up in a moment
or so now. Has—has it been such a terribly long wait?”</p>

<p>I made amends for my rudeness then, assuring her that
the afternoon had been delightful, and presently she
ordered tea and I sat and talked about everything under
the sun, the while I consumed tasteless nothings with a
very dry mouth. For I was terribly anxious.</p>

<p>But time passed, the minute hand of the little Louis
XV. clock on, the mantelpiece moved relentlessly on
toward six o’clock, and Natalie did not come. Until at last
I could wait no longer, whether I wanted to or not; for
I had to keep my appointment with Moore.</p>

<p>By the time I left, Mrs. Trevor had grown anxious
herself, and as the butler let me out, I heard my hostess
calling Mrs. Fawcette’s number into the telephone.</p>

<p>All the way back to my apartment I kept trying to
reassure myself. They had gone for a drive and the car
had broken down. Natalie had met an old friend and
had forgotten the time. There had been a fire near by.
Anything might have happened to delay her. But it did
no good. Mrs. Fawcette was a dangerous woman. I had
plenty of evidence that she was mixed up with some sort
of an organization outside the law. And Natalie had been
in her house. However, I could do nothing about it until
my affair of that night with Moore was settled.</p>

<p>I reached home at a quarter past six. Larry met me
at the door with the news that a high-powered Bengal
car, with an expert driver, was waiting for me around the
corner, and that a comfortable old lounge suit and Larry’s
own revolver, freshly oiled and loaded, were waiting for
me on my bed. Efficiency was Larry’s middle name.
Thank the Lord he could reason as well as play the fool.</p>

<p>I changed in five minutes, arguing with Larry the
while. Romance was rampant in Larry, and he could not
understand anybody who started out on an adventure
without packing a gun. “Come now, sor, do but slip it in
yer pocket. ’Tis maybe not likely ye’ll want it, but if
ye do, ye’ll want it terrible bad. See, sor, it fits snug——”</p>

<p>“Get out with you, Larry, this isn’t the Wild West.
Besides, I can’t afford to have the entire population
about my ears, as they would be if I began shooting the
thing off. I’m not coming to blows with any one to-night,
anyway.”</p>

<p>Larry shook his head sadly. “Well, sor, I wish ye’d
take it,” he said. In this instance and in another one,
later, Larry’s instinct was a good deal better than my
judgment.</p>

<p>Just before I left the apartment I rang up Mrs. Trevor.
But Natalie had not returned and I started with a heavy
heart. Last of all, I warned Larry to stay near the
telephone, to answer Moore if he called. Then I sallied
forth to speak to the driver of the Bengal.</p>

<p>I found him where Larry had told him to wait and
arranged with him that he should park the car just
round the corner from Moore’s house and lounge on the
corner, where he could keep an eye on both me and the
house. From his grin, I imagine that he thought I was
planning an abduction. But he did what he was told.</p>

<p>I stationed myself in the window of a corner
drug-store, across the street from the car, and waited, keeping
a sharp eye on Moore’s house.</p>

<p>It was a long wait. Seven o’clock came and passed,
with the driver of the Bengal kicking his heels on the
opposite curb and I lounging about the drug-store and
staring down the inquiring glances of an anemic-looking drug
clerk. At seven-ten I bought some cigars that I did not
want. At seven-thirty I bought and drank one of the
most horrible soft drinks that I have ever encountered.
And at seven-forty-five I began to get desperate.</p>

<p>However, I waited until eight o’clock before I
ventured out of the shelter of the store. The street was
deserted except for a limousine drawn up near an
apartment house at the other end of the block. I walked
slowly towards Moore’s house, signaling to my driver to
stay where he was.</p>

<p>In front of the house I hesitated for a moment or
two. Then I rang Moore’s bell. There was no answer.
I rang again. Still no answer. So at last I opened
the door with the duplicate key Moore had given me and
mounted the familiar stairs to his apartment.</p>

<p>Arrived at his door, I knocked several times. But
apparently his rooms were empty, and I was just turning
away in indecision when I remembered that I had a key
to his front door also.</p>

<p>His living-room was very much as I remembered it.
But it was quite empty. Things were going wrong with
my plans that day with a vengeance.</p>

<p>“Moore!” I called. “Oh, Moore!”</p>

<p>There was no answer, and I circled his center table
and started for the door of his bedroom beyond, where
the telephone was, with the thought of calling up Larry
to find out whether Moore had sent him a message to
the effect that there had been some change in the
plan.</p>

<p>As I passed the table I noticed a half-sheet of
note-paper lying on the blotter. My name was at the top
of it and I snatched it up and read it.</p>

<blockquote class="letter">

  <p class="salutation">“Dear Clayton,</p>

  <p>“They have just driven up outside. Three of
  them. I am going with them if necessary because I
  daren’t give the game away by delaying them an hour.
  It’s 5.30 now. I’ll try to leave this where you will find it.
  They’re at the door now. Perhaps you can follow.</p>

  <p class="signature">“Moore.”</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Below his signature was another line, written so hastily
that it looked hardly the same handwriting:</p>

<blockquote class="letter">

  <p>“Look at the wires!”</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I slipped the note into my pocket and ran into his
bedroom. The telephone was intact, but at the back of the
clothes closet in which he kept it I found two wires
evidently cut from the reel left over from the original
installation, running up the wall and through a tiny hole in
the ceiling. They were roughly joined to the two wires
of our telephone.</p>

<p>Our line had been tapped!</p>

<p>I hesitated for a moment and read his note again.
The appeal for help in that sentence, “Perhaps you can
follow,” set me raging with anger and dismay. They had
been playing with us all along, then. They knew all our
plans. That was why they had come early probably.
And now Moore was helpless in their hands.</p>

<p>The wires that tapped our line evidently ran into the
empty flat above. So, in the faint hope of learning
something further, I locked Moore’s door again and mounted
the stairs with rising anxiety and anger. It is no pleasant
thing at any time to realize that you have been played
with as a mouse is played with by a cat. I firmly believed
now that this same gang had been responsible for
Margaret’s disappearance. And now Moore was in their
hands and—possibly—Natalie. For it was no good
blinking the facts. And they had been laughing at
us—playing with us—all the while.</p>

<p>I never stopped to think whether the door of the
vacant flat might be locked. I was prepared to break it
down anyway, for I was past the stage of trying to keep
up appearances and work in the dark, and I never stopped
to wonder whether there might be other people in the
house who would have something to say about what was
going on—the young doctor, for instance.</p>

<p>Instead, I went up to the door and tried the handle
cautiously. For there might be a watcher in there still.
To my amazement, the door gave under my hand and
swung open, and I stepped as silently as I could into a
pitch-dark room.</p>

<p>I stood for an instant trying to peer into the darkness.
But I could see nothing, and I released the handle of the
door and began to feel my way along the wall toward
where the window should be.</p>

<p>Then I stopped and stood motionless.</p>

<p>The door had closed softly behind me.</p>

<p>I listened for a moment, and sudden panic took me
by the throat, for the room was alive all around me.
There were faint rustling sounds from two or three
directions, though I could not place them exactly in the
now complete darkness. And I knew instinctively that
I had walked into a trap. But before I could make any
plan I was blinking in a glare of light and looking into the
muzzle of a revolver, in the steady hand of Vining. A
quick glance, as my hands went up, revealed two other
men, one on either side, closing in on me. Vining laughed
at my expression.</p>

<p>“This is kind of you, Clayton,” he drawled at last.
“And no mask on this time. Well, well, truss him up,
you fellows, and I’ll whistle for the car.” He addressed
me again: “My poor friend, this kind of thing is really
not in your line. Why, you made no better showing than
the redoubtable Moore, here.”</p>

<p>I glanced aside and behind him. Against the farther
wall, bound and gagged, lay Moore.</p>

</div>

<hr class="x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter" id="ch12">

<h2>Chapter XII. <br> Disaster!</h2>

<p>I stood motionless, my hands above my head,
staring at Moore and taking in the situation. Then I
became aware that Vining was speaking again.</p>

<p>“Wait a minute,” he was saying. “You, Felix, whistle
for the car from the window there, while I keep this fool
covered.” Then he went on to me: “You thought you’d
mix yourself up with something that didn’t concern you,
didn’t you? Well, you’re going to get your fill of that
before we’re through with you. I had already made
arrangements to dispose of you, my dear Clayton, but when
we took your friend Moore into custody, I happened to
find his note to you, and I added a word or two myself,
as I thought it as well to dispose of you both at the same
time. Your efforts to interest yourself in us were
amusing for a while. But they have gone far enough.”</p>

<p>I paid no particular attention to this tirade. One of
the other men had been struggling with the rusty
fastenings of the window, and now he got it up and stuck his
head out and whistled. I glanced toward Moore. He had
twisted his head so that he could see me, and as I caught
his eye he contrived to signal with his head for me to get
out. His generosity was the last straw. On a sudden my
rage boiled over and I went completely berserk.
Vining’s second companion, a thin, dark-visaged fellow, stood
almost beside me, and I dropped my hands, swung round
to him and let him have it on the point of the jaw. He
went down full length, with a crash that shook the house.</p>

<p>Vining gave a shout and started for me, reversing
and clubbing his revolver as he came, while the other
fellow, who had just drawn his head in the window, ran
forward, crouched and flung himself at my legs.</p>

<p>Vining caught the look in my eye and swerved aside
just before he reached me, so that I had time to bark my
knuckles on the bullet head of the third man. It spoiled
his tackle, but his shoulder struck my legs and we went
down together. I saw Vining coming for me again, and
as I went over backwards, I contrived to catch his
accomplice by the shoulders and hoist him over my head.
Vining’s blow with the butt of the revolver must have fallen
on the man’s back, for I felt the thud of it and the fellow
gave a yell of pain. In an instant I had wriggled free
and struggled to my feet. Vining had jumped back and
was waiting for me, his gun pointed again and murder in
his eye. Nevertheless, madness still held me, I ducked
my head a little and went for him. Then the revolver
went off almost in my face. My last conscious
recollection was the heat of it on the top of my head.</p>

<hr>

<p>When I regained consciousness I was in total
darkness. I sat up, hanging on to a splitting head with both
hands and trying to recall what had happened to me.
A moment later I discovered that the back of my head
was wet and sticky. From somewhere in the house there
was an uproar of voices and trampling feet. I got up, felt
about me, and finally located first the door and then the
wall switch. The lights flared on and showed me an empty
room. My assailants were gone and they had taken
Moore with them.</p>

<p>For a moment or two I confess that I felt overwhelmed
with a sense of sheer disaster. Moore was gone to
goodness knew what fate—and I had done nothing to help
him. And Natalie——</p>

<p>Then came the reflection that at least they had not
taken me with them too. I was still free and still able
to act on Moore’s behalf. And by this time Natalie might
have reached her aunt’s house safe and sound.</p>

<p>A little reflection convinced me that they had left
me behind because Vining’s shot had been heard.
Probably the driver of their car had joined them, and the
three men had carried out Moore and the dark-visaged
victim of my first blow between them, unless the latter
had regained consciousness. They might have even had
to fight their way out through a crowd. That also
probably explained the present commotion in the house, which
was steadily drawing nearer. Then my heart leaped with
hope. Perhaps Vining had been captured and Moore
freed!</p>

<p>The door into the hall was closed but not locked. As
I opened it a roar of voices swept up to meet me from the
hall below.</p>

<p>I walked to the stairs and then staggered slowly down
them, my hands to my head. The lower hall was full of
people, including two policemen. They were all talking
excitedly. But there was no sign of either Moore or
Vining. I must have been a pretty object, having smeared
blood from my head over most of my face, for when
they caught sight of me, there was a shout of surprise and
then an open-mouthed silence. I staggered on down to
them unassisted.</p>

<p>“Officer,” I called weakly, “I have been robbed and
nearly murdered. I live just around the corner. Take
me home, will you? Then I’ll tell you all about it. I
need a doctor.”</p>

<p>Instantly the official spirit asserted itself. “Clear out
of here, all of you!” shouted one of the policemen to the
indignant crowd. The other came up a step or two and
took my arm. “Easy now, sir, and what’s your address,
did you say?”</p>

<p>I told him my address very quietly, and we passed
on and out of the house, through a crowd that looked
to me as big as Times Square on election night. At the
corner the crowd was still following us, in spite of the
efforts of the other policeman to disperse it. But the car
I had hired was still waiting. I signaled to the driver
and he opened the door for us. “Drive us round a bit,”
I told him, “and then take me home. I want to lose this
crowd.” Then I and the two stalwart but puzzled cops
entered the car and drove off amid a small cheer. I never
have understood why a man who is fool enough to get
himself hurt deserves a cheer in the minds of the casual
crowd.</p>

<p>I had a relapse as soon as we got into the car, and by
the time we drew up at my apartment and they had
practically carried me in, I had about convinced them that I
was too sick to be questioned for the present.</p>

<p>Larry met us at the door in answer to my ring. He
gave a shout of rage at the sight of my face. But he
picked me up, the whole six-foot odd of me, and carried
me into my room as gently as a mother carries a child.
Poor Larry, I hated to fool him like that, but the cops
had to be fooled too.</p>

<p>I lay back on the bed and spoke in a feeble voice.
“Larry, fetch a doctor, will you? Or wait, you’d better
tie this up yourself.” Then I turned to one of the
policemen. “Officer, I’m afraid I can’t tell you much. Three
men I have never seen before signaled to me as I was
passing in my car and asked me to help them. They had
a car pulled up in front of that house and were standing
beside it. They told me that two people had been
overcome with gas and they needed help to carry them out.
I never thought that it might be a trap. Then when I got
upstairs they tried to rob me, and when I resisted, one of
them shot me. That’s all I know. I—I——” and as a
conclusion to my speech, I fell back in as good an
imitation of a faint as I could contrive.</p>

<p>Larry leaned over me at once, and as he did so I
whispered, “Get rid of them.”</p>

<p>Then he straightened up again. “By God, they’ve
pretty nigh done for him, the blackguyards!” he cried.
“ ’Tis a docther he needs, and he’ll talk no more to-night,
gentlemen. It might kill him.”</p>

<p>From under lowered lids I could see the two cops
glance at each other. I stirred a little. “Larry,” I called
faintly, “thank the officers in a fitting manner for
bringing me home and—and—beg them to come back in the
morning. I’ll tell them—the details—then.” I closed
my eyes again.</p>

<p>Larry turned on the two cops. “Why ain’t ye catchin’
the fellas that done this thing?” he demanded. “He’s
told ye all he knows an’ he’s a dyin’ man this minut. I’ve
to dress his head before he dies on me hands.” Then
he reached into his pocket, brought out some bills, from
which he selected two and presented one to each of the
cops. “There now, come back in an hour if ye like.
Maybe he can talk then,” and Larry darted out of the
room.</p>

<p>The two stood irresolute for a moment. One of them
took out a notebook and wrote in it. And after a glance
at each other they went out. I heard one of them talking
to Larry for a moment and then the outside door closed
on them. A moment later Larry came back with a basin
of hot water and some cloths.</p>

<p>While he was bandaging my head, I told him what
had happened. The bullet had creased me—that is, it
had grazed my skull under the skin for an inch or so and
come out again. The wound was nothing that would
not heal up in a day or two. But my news was very
serious indeed, and Larry, who had taken a great liking to
Moore, was full of indignation and threats of vengeance.</p>

<p>However, we had little time allowed us for making
plans for the future.</p>

<p>I had just finished telling Larry of my fears
concerning Miss Van Cleef as he pressed down the last bit of
adhesive plaster on the back of my head. I sent him to
call up her aunt’s house and find out whether the girl
had returned or not. But before he reached it, the
telephone bell rang. Larry answered, and after a word or
two that I could not catch, came running in to me, his
face long with apprehension.</p>

<p>“Sure, sor, ’tis thot Captain Peters on the wire. He
wants to speak to ye and says there’s not a minut to
spare.”</p>

<p>I hurried into my study and sitting down at my desk,
took up the receiver. “Hello, Captain Peters. This is
Clayton speaking.”</p>

<p>“Hello, Clayton,” came the police officer’s gruff voice
over the wire. “I’ve just heard that there was a row up
at our friend’s place this afternoon and you got hurt.
What happened?”</p>

<p>“They got him,” I answered. “Got clear away with
him as far as I know, and nearly got me. They know
all about us.”</p>

<p>“That’s bad—bad,” answered the captain. “But
there’s worse to follow. You’ve got to get out of there
at once, sir. At once. I just learned that there’s a
charge against ye and they’re coming after ye to-night.
Some matter of a burglary. Your card-case was found
in the burgled house of a man named Vining. If they
ever get ye in jail they’ll keep ye there, or maybe they’ll
do ye in on the way. Better get out and lay low right
away.”</p>

<p>“But, great Scott, Captain, can’t you——”</p>

<p>“I cannot, sir. I haven’t the power in any case, and
they’re big, powerful men ye’re up against. Even the
Chief could not save you from arrest once the warrant is
issued. Better get out, sir.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, can you get in touch with our
Chief—Moore’s Chief—and tell him the news, Captain?”</p>

<p>“I can that, sir, and I will!”</p>

<p>“One thing more, Captain. Are they going to arrest
Larry?”</p>

<p>“Your man, sir. No, I don’t think so. The warrant
is only for ye yerself. But they may take him in as an
accessory after the fact, if they don’t find ye—or even
if they do get ye.”</p>

<p>“But can’t you prevent that, Captain? I’ve got to
have a base somewhere. I think they got Miss Van
Cleef to-day, too. If Larry stays here, and I can reach
him by ’phone, it will help some.”</p>

<p>“Better not risk it then, sir. Take him with ye. And
the two of ye go into hiding. I’m risking a lot to tell
ye this, but get out quick. They’re likely on the way
for ye now.”</p>

<p>“All right, Captain,” I answered. “Tell the Chief
immediately everything about Miss Van Cleef, too, will
you?”</p>

<p>“I will that, sir. Good-by!” and the captain rang
off.</p>

<p>Events were moving too fast for me, and I sat at the
desk for a moment, my aching head reeling with the
thousand and one details of it all and the thousand and
one dangers that faced me. But there was no time to
lose.</p>

<p>I shouted to Larry to pack a bag for himself and one
for me. “We’re getting out of here at once,” I told
him. “The police are after us both. That is, we are
getting out if you want to come. There’s no warrant
for your arrest, but there is for mine.”</p>

<p>“By gad, sor, thot’s bad,” Larry shouted back from
the other room. Then I heard him chuckle, “Shall I
take me little kit o’ tools?”</p>

<p>“Of course take it. Do you want them to find it?”</p>

<p>A moment later we were both packing like mad. We
threw a few things into a couple of bags, and then with
a last look around we closed the door of my apartment
behind us for an indefinite period, and turned our faces
toward the cold world, or, at least, toward the elevator
which was to take us into the cold world. I always kept
a considerable amount of cash available, so that at least
we had money.</p>

<p>Events that day had gone as badly as they possibly
could go. I was desperately worried about Moore and
about Natalie also, although she might simply have been
delayed in getting home. But somehow Larry’s chuckle
had changed the trend of my thoughts, and I faced the
prospect of venturing forth into hiding with a good deal
of elation. I was free and comparatively undamaged.
And if Moore could not be rescued by a man with the
whole weight of the Secret Service behind him, then
something was wrong. Anyway, when there was work to be
done, even bombing reluctant Germans, I had always
appreciated the opportunity of something stirring and
immediately forgotten to worry about the event.</p>

<p>But our first glimpse of the outside world was a good
deal warmer than either of us cared about.</p>

<p>We were just approaching the front door when a
police patrol wagon drew up in front of it outside. Of
course it was quite dark by this time, but the arc light
on the corner showed me the patrol wagon and several
policemen besides the driver. I hesitated an instant,
but two policemen jumped down at once and approached
the entrance and there was nothing to do but put a bold
face on it and walk out.</p>

<p>“Come on, Larry,” I muttered. “If they stop us we’ll
bolt in opposite directions and meet at ten o’clock in the
Times Square drug store.” And so we sallied forth.</p>

<p>We walked out calmly enough, looking the two
policemen casually in the eye, and they stepped back to let
us pass. But when we reached the sidewalk I looked
back, like a fool, and one of them had his eye on us.
The other was talking to the elevator attendant and I
suddenly realized that he was probably being told that I
had just passed him.</p>

<p>I glanced away at once, and my eye suddenly fell on
the car that Larry had hired that afternoon, still
standing where I had left it. I found out afterwards that
Larry had hired it for the entire evening, and the driver
figured that if he stuck around he could claim pay for
that time, as I had not dismissed him. It was
questionable ethics, as he must have believed me to be nearly
killed and very unlikely to want him again, but I blessed
him for it.</p>

<p>“There’s the car, Larry. Jump in!” I told him quickly.
As we approached it, there was a shout from behind us
in the doorway.</p>

<p>“To the Grand Central!” I shouted to the driver, “and
go like the devil.”</p>

<p>We tumbled into the car as the driver stepped on his
starter. Fortunately the engine started at once, and he
slipped in his first gear and the clutch almost
immediately, so that we were already moving when the first cop
reached the car. “Here,” he yelled. “Stop, you! I
want to talk to you!” And he jumped on to the running
board.</p>

<p>I leaned toward him. “Sorry. No time. Got to
catch a train. Jump down before you get hurt!”</p>

<p>We were out from the curb now and picking up speed.
But the cop had plenty of pluck. Instead of
answering he fumbled for his whistle and put it to his lips. At
the same moment my fist shot past his arm to the side
of his jaw, and he released his hold and fell backward,
rolling over and over in the street. I hated to do it,
but we had no time for argument.</p>

<p>There came another shout from behind, together with
a startled exclamation from our own driver, who had
turned and seen the blow. He threw out his clutch and
put on his brake as police whistles began to ring out
behind us, together with the clatter of competent
policemen’s brogues.</p>

<p>Larry leaned forward, and the driver started and gave
a gasp as he felt a cold muzzle nuzzling into the tenderest
part of his neck. “Put in that clutch and step on her,”
urged Larry, “or I’ll blow hell out of you and drive her
myself.”</p>

<p>Unlike the cop, the driver did not stop to argue. He
threw in his clutch and stepped on the accelerator at once,
and we whisked round a corner with a patrol wagon
manned by excited cops and shrilling whistles so close
behind that they could have reached out and touched us.
Once in the straight we drew away from them fast,
however. A moment later we turned into Broadway going
south.</p>

<p>“Go on,” urged Larry, “step on her, you —— ——”</p>

<p>The patrol wagon turned into Broadway a full block
behind us, shrilling and clanging madly. Fortunately we
had joined and then passed some other cars, and the
two traffic cops we passed had no idea which car to stop.
The first one tried to stop us all, but our driver, with
the fear of death on him, whisked round and past him.
Of course the other cars stopped, blocking the road and
effectually preventing the patrol wagon from passing
either. The second cop merely stared.</p>

<p>“Up a side street, quick!” I yelled to our driver. And
as we turned out of Broadway I looked back to see the
vibrating patrol wagon still trying to get past the jam.</p>

<p>“Go over to Eighth,” I told the driver, “and then
downtown to Broadway and on down to Times Square. Make
it snappy. Here’s fifty dollars for yourself alone for this
night’s work, and if they ever catch you, tell them that
we are a desperate gang of thugs and threatened your
life.”</p>

<p>And I fell to laughing, and leaning over, stuffed the
bills into his pocket.</p>

<p>“But—but what’s it all about, sir?” asked the driver
tremulously, over his shoulder.</p>

<p>“It’s a mistake, lad, that’s all. But I can’t stop to
straighten it out now, see? However, I don’t think any
harm will come to you about it, even if they did get
your number.”</p>

<p>“But this afternoon——”</p>

<p>“That was more of it,” I told him. “But I can’t
explain it now. Drop us at Times Square and get back to
the garage, and if you really want to help us out a little,
tell the police, if they catch you, that you dropped us
at the Grand Central.”</p>

<p>The driver was silent at that, and nothing more was
said until he slowed up alongside of the Times Building.
Then he turned and leaned toward me. “Grand Central
it is, sir,” he said. “I guess I know a gentleman when
I see one.”</p>

<p>But I wonder how much the fifty dollars had to do with
his flattering opinion.</p>

<h2>Chapter XIII. <br> Our Second Burglary</h2>

<p>Larry and I went in one entrance to the Times
Building and out the other. I led him across the
street and into Seventh Avenue, turning south.
Already I was beginning to have the feeling of a hunted
criminal and to fear the bright lights.</p>

<p>“Now then, Larry,” I explained, “they’ve seen us like
this. And I think we’d better buy some different clothes.
What do you think?”</p>

<p>“That’s right, sor. It’s old clothes for us and maybe
a couple o’ days’ beard—and lose these bags somewhere
as soon as may be.”</p>

<p>We walked along Seventh for a block or so until we
came to a second-hand store with a fat little Jew
sitting, like the proverbial spider, in the doorway. The
moment he saw us coming he jumped to his feet and
walked us into his parlor, oozing what was meant for
bluff good-fellowship at every pore.</p>

<p>I told him that we had decided to take a job together
with a construction gang, and we wanted clothes that
would wear better than those we had on. I offered to
swap him the clothes we had for the kind we wanted.
And there I made a mistake.</p>

<p>“Vant ta change close?” he cried. “Get into the back
room there, quick. I’ll take care of ye fine.”</p>

<p>We moved back to the rear of the shop and the Jew
hustled us into a filthy little room in which he evidently
both slept and ate his meals. A moment later he joined
us with several old suits of rough-looking workmen’s
clothes and some worn, heavy boots—also a couple of
rough army shirts. “There you are, my friendths.
Change quickly. You’re in safe hands.”</p>

<p>Larry and I picked out a couple of suits and changed
into them and the army shirts very rapidly, paying very
little attention to our Jewish friend. The boots were
harder, but we presently found a couple of pairs that
fitted us fairly well. Then we shifted our few personal
belongings and our money to our new clothes and tossed
the old ones we had taken off to the Jew. “There you
are, Isaac,” said Larry. “There’s the best two suits you
ever had in your shop and you’re getting ’em for
nothing.”</p>

<p>The Jew rubbed his hands together. “Oh, no, my
friends, you make a joke,” said he. “Those good suits
are twenty-fife tollars apiece, if you leave the old clothes
you take off. Oddervise they are thirty-five tollars each.”
He paused, smiling. “The boots and shirts I gif you
for only tventy tollars!”</p>

<p>We turned and stared at him. Instantly he began to
retreat toward the door, still smiling uncertainly. “You
pay me or I call the bolice!” he cried. “I don’t sell no
disguises fer nodding.”</p>

<p>That little Jew never knew what struck him. Larry
leaped in the air and pounced on him as a cat pounces
on a mouse. The little man had time for only a
frightened gasp before he was pinned to the floor, his eyes
starting from his head as Larry throttled him.</p>

<p>“Ye wud, wud ye, ye little Judas,” Larry cried,
shaking him. “I’ve a mind to kill ye this minute and set fire
to your damned shack. Shall I kill him, sor?” he asked,
twisting his head to wink at me.</p>

<p>I hesitated. “Perhaps you’d better,” I said. “No,
wait a minute. Maybe he’ll be useful to us. We can
come back and kill him later. Let him up, but hold on
to him.”</p>

<p>Larry lifted the little man to his feet and he instantly
fell on his knees again. “I vas only choking, sir. The
clothes are for noddings. Only let me go, and go away.
I’ll say nodding to no one that you came here.”</p>

<p>“All right,” I answered. “Let him go, Larry. But
remember,” I added, “that if you ever breathe a word
to any one of our having been here, one or both of us
will come back here and kill you sure. We’ve murdered
nine men already this year, and you’re not a man
anyway.” Then we went out. The Jew’s face as we left
was the touch of comedy we both needed.</p>

<p>We walked on down Seventh Avenue, planning the
future as we went. I decided that it would be better
for us to take separate rooms in separate boarding houses,
somewhere down around 10th or 11th Streets, west of
Sixth Avenue. It is, or was at that time, a forsaken
backwater of a district, whither the flotsam and jetsam of
spent lives seemed to drift, and where one seemed in
New York but no longer of it. Thither drifted old maids,
widows in straitened circumstances, drunkards slowly
dying, remittance men of kindred vices, and the poorer
element of Americans new to the city—often fresh from
the farm or the small western town.</p>

<p>And late as it was, we had no difficulty in finding
rooms. Larry hired himself a little hole on the ground
floor on 11th Street, with a tiny window, no wider than
his head, opening into an air-shaft. I found a place in
13th Street a couple of flights up and a little larger than
his, but unostentatious enough. However, they were
both fairly clean rooms, and both houses had telephones.
We insisted upon that. Of course we had to pay in
advance.</p>

<p>Larry gave his name as Tom O’Dowd and I gave mine
as Michael Swift. Then, when we had stowed our bags
away, we went out and walked a little, exchanged
telephone numbers, and I arranged with Larry that he should
make it a point to stay in the house from ten to twelve
every morning and from six to midnight every night.
The rest of the time he could do as he pleased, taking
care to keep out of sight of possible police search. For
I warned him that, in view of the high influences
evidently back of the attempt to arrest us, they would not
give up the search for us in a hurry.</p>

<p>We parted and went to bed without further incident
that night. And that was a good thing, for if two men
ever needed a rest we did. I was weak from loss of
blood anyway, and I had had enough excitement that day
to satisfy any one.</p>

<p>But the moment my head touched the pillow I began
worrying about first Natalie and then Moore and it was
long before I got to sleep. All that I had accomplished
so far, it seemed, was to bring peril to two more people,
instead of finding Margaret. But I was in a pretty low
frame of mind that night.</p>

<p>The next morning, however, things looked very
different. The breakfast they brought up to my rooms—for
I explained that I had been knocked down in the street,
through my newness to traffic—was better than I
expected. And I was enjoying it thoroughly—until I
opened the paper. Then the breakfast was forgotten.
For the front page had a full account of the strange
disappearance of Miss Van Cleef and the hue and cry that
had been raised on account of it.</p>

<p>The police were at fault as usual, and the paper I had,
which happened to be anti-Tammany, waxed almost
hysterical over the great number of recent
disappearances and the helplessness of the police. The greater
part of the article was confined to this sort of thing.</p>

<p>About the only piece of news of value to me was the
fact that Natalie had been last seen when she left the
house to start for Mrs. Fawcette’s luncheon. She had,
it seemed, arrived at the house, but a little later had
complained of a severe headache and had had a taxi called
and started for home in it. Nothing had been seen of
her since. Mrs. Fawcette was prostrated at the news
and had canceled all her social engagements. She was
quoted as feeling almost responsible in a way for the
girl’s disappearance.</p>

<p>This was a daringly artistic touch in which I thought I
recognized Mrs. Fawcette’s peculiar brand of humor.
For nearly an hour I prowled around my room, shaking
with rage and anxiety. It is anything but pleasant to
know that some one you love is in danger—terrible
danger perhaps—and be utterly helpless. I knew that Mrs.
Fawcette was at the bottom of Natalie’s disappearance.
But I had not the faintest shadow of a proof. Nor had
I any idea as to where the girl might be.</p>

<p>But after a while I came to a decision. I was morally
certain that Mrs. Fawcette knew about the girl’s
disappearance. Therefore I must try somehow to get some
information through Mrs. Fawcette. I could not get this
directly, for I was wanted by the police, and Mrs.
Fawcette had stolen the card-case that involved me in the
burglarious entry into Vining’s rooms. But it was
possible that I might be able to find out something in her
house or through her servants. And suddenly my heart
gave a leap. Perhaps Natalie was still there, imprisoned
in the woman’s house. Mrs. Fawcette had canceled all
her social engagements!</p>

<p>I could do nothing until midnight, however. That was
certain. But then, knowing the interior of the house,
downstairs at least, as I did, it would be very bad luck
indeed if Larry and I, or I alone, could not get into the
house and out again without being caught. I had no
scruples in taking Larry, if he wanted to come, because I
knew that if we got into trouble with the police, I could
clear him finally through the Chief.</p>

<p>Before everything else, however, it was necessary to
make sure that the Chief in Washington knew the
details of all that had happened up to date. My
experiences the night before had given me such an uneasy sense
of the omniscience of our opponents that I had asked
Captain Peters to communicate with the Chief himself,
to make doubly sure that the message was not intercepted,
but I had my own report to make in any case.</p>

<p>I had memorized the letters on the Underwood in the
order in which they were arranged, and after a laborious
hour I turned a pretty full account of Natalie’s
disappearance, Moore’s capture and my own adventures and
suspicions into code, including my new address. Then I
picked up my cap, which concealed my bandaged head,
and sallied forth to send it off as a special delivery letter.</p>

<p>Fortunately nothing happened. I felt a good deal like
a criminal, and crossed corners to avoid passing in front
of policemen. One or two of them seemed to look at me
closely, which may have been my imagination or may
have been due to my workman’s clothes. But none of
them stopped me.</p>

<p>It was a curious sensation, however. I had a feeling
of insecurity that sent cold chills up my back once or
twice and I was exceedingly glad to get back to the
house. Being wanted by the police seems exciting and
warming in the story-books; but I would never
recommend anybody to try it on that account. I did not like
it at all! Then, too, if I had been arrested, with Moore
gone, the fat <em>would</em> have been in the fire.</p>

<p>I mailed my letter and got safely back to the house.
Then I called up Tom O’Dowd, <i>alias</i> Larry Malloy.</p>

<p>“Is that yersilf, sor? Sure it’s me that has been on
the anxious seat the morning through.”</p>

<p>“It is, Tom. And forget that ‘sir,’ will you? It’s a
fine thing to have one workman calling another workman
sir, isn’t it!”</p>

<p>There was a pause. “ ’Twouldn’t do at all, sor,” said
Larry.</p>

<p>I laughed. “There you go again. Now listen, Tom.
Business is good, for I’ve found a little job of work for
the two of us to-night. It’s at a lady’s house in the
Seventies. ’Tis the house of the lady you saw yesterday at
noon. I want you to meet me to-night at the corner of
14th Street and Seventh Avenue, in the little saloon there,
and bring your tools with you. Do you understand?”</p>

<p>There was a silence.</p>

<p>“Hello, Tom?”</p>

<p>“Yis, sor —I mean, Mike. What sort of a job would it
be this time?”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you when I see you.”</p>

<p>“What’s the address, Mike?”</p>

<p>I told him, laughing.</p>

<p>“And what toime should I meet you?”</p>

<p>“Make it ten o’clock sharp, Tom.”</p>

<p>“All right. I’ll be there. Good-by,” and he rang off.</p>

<p>I ordered lunch in my room, and after the landlady
had explained with some heat that there would be an
extra charge for having it served that way, I got it.
When luncheon was over I settled down and tried to
read a magazine. But it was hopeless. My thoughts
would not keep themselves on the story but kept
chasing each other round and round, until I gave it up as a
bad job. Finally, I decided that a good rest would be in
order, in view of the possibility that I would be up most
of the night, and the certainty that I would need my wits
about me. So I lay down, and after half an hour or so
fell asleep.</p>

<p>It was well after eight o’clock when I woke up,
ravenously hungry. I had a latch-key, so I left the house
quietly without seeing any one. I slouched into a little
quick-lunch restaurant on Sixth Avenue and, sitting with
my cap on, put away a large-sized meal. I borrowed a
paper from the waiter and sat reading it and smoking,
with my back to the street, until about ten minutes to
ten. Then I set out to meet Larry. My head was still
rather painful, but the autumn air was fresh and
invigorating, and the thought of action was an unfailing
stimulus. In any kind of affair that requires patient
watching I am a hopeless failure. For the thought of Natalie’s
fate drove me nearly wild to do something, although my
plan promised a slim enough chance of learning any news
of her.</p>

<p>Larry was sitting in the little back parlor of the saloon,
immersed in a much-thumbed copy of the <i>Police Gazette</i>.
I slouched up to his table and sat down, banging on the
top of it for the waiter. I had a two-days’ beard by now
and my hands were as dirty as they could get in the time
allowed them. So I had little fear of being picked up
and arrested for the burglary.</p>

<p>“Lo, Mike,” said Larry, looking up. “Phwat’s new
wid ye?”</p>

<p>“Hell—nothin’!” I answered, and then to the waiter:
“Gimme a beer.”</p>

<p>The waiter looked me over curiously until I caught his
eye. Then he shuffled hastily away. Larry leaned over
the table. “Drink yer beer and let’s git out av ut, sor,
I don’t like the waiter. He moight be a stool-pidgeon.”
He winked. “This is a bit of a hang-out fer the
gangsters around here, d’ye disremember, sor?”</p>

<p>Larry and I had witnessed a bloodthirsty and noisy
gun fight there some weeks before, but I had forgotten
the details, except that the aim had been poor and the
battle comparatively bloodless.</p>

<p>However, we drank our beer and then strolled out,
turning north along Seventh Avenue. Presently we
boarded a Seventh Avenue car, and stood out on the
front platform until we got off at 55th Street.</p>

<p>We turned east on 55th, and Larry led me into a
doorway and up a flight of stairs into a little pool room with
only a couple of pool tables in it.</p>

<p>“This place is all right,” he whispered. “ ’Tis an old
joint of mine. Now we can sit down and palaver fer a
bit. ’Tis too early to start anything yet.”</p>

<p>We found two chairs and sat watching the game.
“Don’t you think we ought to look the place over from
the outside first?” I asked him.</p>

<p>Larry grinned. “Sure, what wud Oi be doin’ the whole
blessed afternoon?” he demanded.</p>

<p>I stared at him. “Do you mean to say——”</p>

<p>“Asy now, sor,” he grinned. “Sure, ’twas no risk at
all, at all, to be slouchin’ by the house a few toimes. An’
I had a bit av luck, sor. A woman druv up in a taxi wid
a big trunk. I helped the taxi driver up the stairs with
ut, and then had a good look out the back windows while
the woman was payin’ him off. ’Twas but two doors
away from the house we’re afther, an’ I got the lay av
the land. You lave the gittin’ in to me, sor. ’Twill be
as asy as kiss yer hand.”</p>

<p>“Maybe, Larry,” I whispered. “But we want some
idea of who’s in the place, too. I think we’d better get
as close as we can and keep an eye on the house for an
hour or so. We don’t want to run into the whole pack
of them. And maybe we can get an idea of what they’re
up to also.”</p>

<p>“ ’Tis a good notion, sor. Let’s go.” And we tramped
out again.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fawcette’s house was in the middle of the block
between Fifth and Sixth Avenues. It was a brown-stone
house with two sets of double doors up a flight of stone
steps and a heavy iron grille leading into the basement.
To me it looked absolute madness to attempt to break in.
But I had a good deal of faith in Larry by this time. So
I was principally intent on watching the house and
getting an idea as to how many of Mrs. Fawcette’s friends
we would find there.</p>

<p>However, although we stationed ourselves near by in
an area, keeping a sharp lookout for passing policemen,
and watched for more than an hour, no one either went in
or came out. And Larry was getting as impatient as I
was.</p>

<p>Presently he touched me on the shoulder. “Oi have a
plan, sor,” he whispered. “Do but folley me close and
mebbe we can tell more about what is goin’ on in there.
Wait a minute, sor. I bought this fer you to-day. Do
but take it now, and if ye need it, use it. ’Tis better to
kill than be killed. And they’ll stop at nothin’, what
Oi’ve seen av thim.” He slipped a revolver into my
hand. “ ’Tis loaded and ready, sor,” he finished.</p>

<p>Larry came out of the area, glanced sharply up and
down the street and then walked calmly away from Mrs.
Fawcette’s house. There was a big apartment house
about five doors down and on the same side of the street,
with a tradesmen’s entrance running back along the side
of it. Larry made a bee line for this entrance, with me
at his heels, and turned into it. Fortunately there was
no one in sight at the time and we made our way quietly
to the rear of the place.</p>

<p>It was pitch dark back there and I brought up against
Larry with a sudden bump. “Quiet now, sor,” he
whispered. “Here’s the wall and here’s a barrel to stand on,
for ’tis a high one. Up you go.” He grabbed my arm.
“Wait! Throw me coat over ut first.”</p>

<p>I’ve climbed some walls in my day, but that one was
the worst. It was at least ten feet high and covered
with glass at the top. The barrel we had to stand on
was a tin ash-can that rattled if you looked at it. And
we both had to jump from it to reach the top of the
wall. It separated the apartment yard from the one
next door.</p>

<p>However, I threw Larry’s coat over the top to protect
my hands from the glass, and we scrambled over
somehow, dropping on to a border of soft earth on the other
side. Larry managed to bring his coat down with him.</p>

<p>Then, in single file, and moving as quietly as we could,
we crossed yard after yard, scaling the fences as we
came to them. Fortunately they were a good deal easier
than the first one.</p>

<p>For twenty minutes or so we kept up this scrambling
and dropping, sneaking past lighted windows with our
hearts in our mouths, and expecting every minute to
have some one throw up one of the blank windows above
us and yell for the police. Finally, when we were both
puffing and blowing, and I, at least, was hopelessly lost,
Larry caught my sleeve.</p>

<p>“ ’Tis the house, sor,” he whispered. “And here is
where we’re going in.”</p>

<p>I stared up at the house. Every window was dark and
I could hear no sound from inside. “But, great Scott,
Larry,” I whispered, “where are all the servants?” For
I knew that Mrs. Fawcette had three at least.</p>

<p>“Gone, sor. Dismissed this morning. The lot av
thim. I asked a housemaid who knew some av thim.
Asked her who lived there, and what wid passin’ the
toime av day, she told me that, too.”</p>

<p>“Well, there’s somebody there at all events, for one
of the front windows upstairs is lighted.”</p>

<p>Then Larry gave me a fright. He chuckled and then
whistled very gently. And before I could even tell him
to shut up, there was a soft footfall behind us and some
one blundered into us in the darkness. I grabbed the
newcomer at once and felt for his throat, but Larry
pulled my hands away. “Tis all right, sor. ’Tis a
friend of mine,” he chuckled. “Well, Tim, phwat’s the
news?”</p>

<p>“Call off your friend first,” came a hoarse whisper.
“Sure, ’tis a grip like a bear he has. But there’s no
news at all, lad. Not a soul has gone in or come out
since ye left this afternoon. I was watching out front
till eleven. Then the block watchman came prowling
around and I come on back here. While I wuz waitin’
I took the liberty av just liftin’ out thim bars fer ye,
just to kape me hand in, like.”</p>

<p>Larry chuckled again. “Tis a good friend ye are,
Tim. But now do ye be gettin’ away out av ut an’ lave
it to us. Good-night.”</p>

<p>“Good-night,” came the hoarse whisper, and the
stranger departed as noiselessly as he had come.</p>

<p>“Come on, sor,” whispered Larry. He took my hand
and led me up to the house until I could reach out and
touch the wall. He seemed to be quite able to see in the
dark, for I heard him fumbling with something for only
a moment and then his hand caught mine again. “Sure,
’tis all done for us, sor. The windy’s open now. Step
over the sill and feel for the floor with yer fut. And
make no sound now for the love av Mike.”</p>

<p>So I stepped into the house, closely followed by Larry.
Once in, he turned and closed the window behind us.
“And now, sor,” he whispered, “we’ll just be going through
the place from cellar to garret. Do but watch yer feet!”
And suddenly a little beam of light flashed, dancing about
me. The search was on.</p>

<h2>Chapter XIV. <br> What We Found</h2>

<p>Larry’s tiny electric torch showed us a small
basement room, evidently used as a laundry. An
unlocked door led from it into the kitchen, an
old-fashioned one and very large. And after listening at the
door for a moment we explored this room also. The fire
was out and the ashes were quite cold, and the coolness
of the air in the room indicated that no fire had been lit
in it that day, or, at least, late that day.</p>

<p>Evidently the housemaid’s tale to Larry about the
discharge of the servants was correct, and we explored
the rest of the basement with more confidence that we
were alone in it. It was quite deserted.</p>

<p>Presently, off the hall-way running the entire length of
the basement floor, we found the stairs leading up to the
floor above. Larry put up a restraining hand here, and
we paused listening for several minutes and peering up
into the darkness. But aside from the tiny creaks and
soft thuds always to be heard at night in an old house,
the floor above was as silent as the basement. I could
hear my own heart thumping away as I listened.</p>

<p>At last Larry gave the signal and we began to creep
silently upward. A board snapped suddenly underfoot
and we both stopped and listened for a while, but
nothing happened, and presently we started on again, raising
and putting down each foot with infinite care until we
stood in the big, carpeted hallway above, staring
cautiously about us.</p>

<p>Larry had put out his torch when we started up the
basement steps. But in the upper hall enough light
filtered in from near-by arc-lights in the street to show us
the dim outlines of furniture already familiar to me from
several visits to Mrs. Fawcette’s house.</p>

<p>It was an eerie sensation standing there at night and
in darkness, on such a search, in this hall which I had
only known as a guest, when it was bright with lights
and color and noisy with laughter and the babble of
voices. But the object of my search and my anxiety over
Natalie swept over me again, and I reached out in the
darkness and touched Larry’s arm impatiently. He turned
and put his lips against my ear.</p>

<p>“There’s nobody on this floor, I think,” he whispered.
“But we’ll give a look round on the chance, sor. ’Tis a
bad thing to lave any one at the back av ye, to cut off
yer retrate maybe.”</p>

<p>We crept along the hall, peering into darkness that was,
as I knew, drawing-room, dining-room, morning-room
and study. But they were all deserted. We knew that
there was some one in the house, in all probability,
because of the light we had seen from the front. But
evidently we had not many people to deal with, at any rate.</p>

<p>As before, we halted, listening, at the foot of the stairs
which led up to the next floor. It was well after
midnight by now and the street outside, and indeed the whole
city, had grown quiet, but in spite of the stillness we
could hear no sound from above.</p>

<p>“Come on, sor,” whispered Larry, and hand in hand
we crept up the thickly carpeted stairs, keeping close to
the wall where the steps were less likely to creak. And
as we advanced the black darkness that was the upper
hall seemed to creep down and envelop us like an
intangible cloud.</p>

<p>But in spite of the sinister element with which my
imagination endowed the darkness, the bedrooms,
bathrooms and the library on that floor also were silent and
untenanted. And with the urge of a growing impatience
to have done with our search and be gone, we mounted
another well-carpeted flight as silently as before.</p>

<p>As our heads topped this floor level, Larry’s hand
gripped my arm suddenly. A thin line of light glowed
from beneath a door a little way up the hall, toward
the front of the house. Larry brought his lips close to
my ear again. “ ’Tis the light we saw from the front,
sor!” he whispered, so softly that I only just caught the
words. “We’ll creep up and listen, try the handle and
then, maybe, fling open the door. You’ll be ready, sor?”</p>

<p>I pressed his arm in assent and Larry started to lead
the way down the hall. Then another plan occurred to
me. I caught his arm and leaned close to him. “How
about searching the rest of the house first?” I whispered.
The recollection was still vivid of the way I had messed
up the affair in Moore’s house, by walking into a trap,
and I thought it would be as well to know whether there
were others besides the inhabitants of that one room.
My idea was based on reason which was well enough, I
thought, but again Larry’s instinct was better.</p>

<p>He turned back, however, and we went through the
rooms on the top floor above, without finding anything
or any one. Then we descended and went through the
rooms on that floor. The last one, next to the room with
the light, had another door leading into it, beneath which
the light showed, and it was in this room that Larry had
the bad luck to fall over a small footstool, making a
noise which a person in the next room could not fail to
hear if he or she were awake. He had fallen to one knee,
but he got up again quickly, smothering a curse, and we
stood waiting tensely in the darkness.</p>

<p>We could hear no sound from the next room, but
suddenly the door we faced was flung open from within and
a man stood framed in the light, crouching a little.</p>

<p>He was a big fellow, nearly filling the doorway. He
said something that sounded like Russian in a quavering
voice, peering into the darkness as he spoke. Then
suddenly, before either of us could move, he vanished.</p>

<p>I dashed into the doorway and the room beyond, with
Larry close at my heels. The big fellow had his hand on
the wall opposite and was just turning away from some
instrument there. As I entered I heard a sound like the
buzzer which is used to call messengers. I was vaguely
conscious that the man held a revolver in my direction
as he turned toward me, but I was so intent upon
reaching him without loss of time that the fact hardly
registered. At any rate, he had no time to fire it, for I was
almost on him as he turned.</p>

<p>My fist caught him between the eyes and he dropped
with a groan, the revolver falling limply from his hand.
Larry was on him like a flash, pocketing his gun. Then I
turned to look at the rest of the room.</p>

<p>In the far corner stood Natalie, her eyes wide with
terror and her hands tied behind her. There was no
recognition in her eyes—only blind apprehension.</p>

<p>“Natalie!” I cried, “Natalie! For God’s sake, what
have they done to you?”</p>

<p>The lovely eyes stared at me, and slowly bewilderment
first and then recognition dawned in them. Then, with
a little cry, she staggered toward me, bound as she was,
and into my arms. “Oh,” she cried, “I knew you’d come.
I knew you’d come for me!”</p>

<p>I held her close for just an instant. Then I turned.
Larry was trussing up the fallen Russian in a
business-like way, with the man’s own necktie, and gagging him
with their combined handkerchiefs. “Your knife, quick,
Larry,” I whispered, for the ache in my throat at the
sight of her would not let me speak aloud.</p>

<p>In an instant Larry was on his feet, and a moment
later Natalie’s hands were free. She flung her arms
around my neck and pressed her lovely face against my
shoulder, weeping softly. “It—it has
been—awful—waiting for you,” she sobbed.</p>

<p>Larry touched my arm. “We must get out av it, sor,”
he whispered. “Twas a signal he gave!”</p>

<p>At his words Natalie straightened herself, shuddering,
and then drew away from me a little shyly. We all
listened. An automobile brake screamed suddenly, either
in front of the house or very near.</p>

<p>Without a word Larry dashed out into the hall. An
instant later he was back again. “Comin’ in here,
sor,” he whispered. “Two av thim. ’Twas his signal,
likely.”</p>

<p>Natalie moaned and swayed against the wall. “Oh,
don’t let them get me again!” she begged, her hands
outstretched. Red marks scarred the white wrists.</p>

<p>And suddenly all desire left me to get out of there
before the newcomers reached us. Somebody was going
to get a lesson that night, I determined.</p>

<p>I ran and closed the two doors. Then I guided Natalie
into the far corner and placed her on a chair, putting
her hands behind her as though tied. I ran to the wall
and tore down the instrument there, spreading the wires
well apart and tucking them far back into the hole in the
plaster which the instrument had left.</p>

<p>There was a couch in the room, and my next move
was to roll the Russian under it and out of sight.
“Behind the door, Larry!” I whispered. As he took up his
position, where the door opening into the hall would
conceal him, I ran to the fireplace, picked up a poker
that lay in it, and darted back to Larry. “Get the
second man as he comes in,” I whispered; “I’ll take care
of the first one!” Then I ran back to Natalie and stood
facing her, my back to the door.</p>

<p>I had just taken up my position when the door was
flung open and two men rushed into the room. There
was a babble of Russian, the two evidently taking me
for the gagged and bound watcher, as I had hoped. Then
I drew my revolver, turned and covered the first man,
just as the poker descended upon the head of the second.
The latter dropped without a sound.</p>

<p>“Oh!” gasped Natalie. “That’s—that’s the man who
struck me. He—he struck me!” she repeated, like an
incredulous child.</p>

<p>“Throw up your hands!” I told him savagely.</p>

<p>The man’s hands went up over his head with a certain
airy grace. “And, pray, who are you?” he demanded
calmly, in a slightly mincing voice, and in excellent
English.
“He was at the luncheon,” Natalie gasped. “Mrs.
Fawcette introduced him to me and he took me in to the
next room to show me some pictures. Then something
pricked my arm, and when I woke up I was
here—and—and he struck me!”</p>

<p>“Search him, Larry!” I cried.</p>

<p>Larry produced a long, slender sheathed knife from
the inside of the man’s trouser band, and a small
instrument, the duplicate of the air-revolver Moore had taken
from the stranger he shot in my room. Then I threw
my own revolver on the couch and started for the airy
and well-dressed newcomer.</p>

<p>It was not a pretty sight. But I don’t believe Natalie
minded that side of it much. The Russian knew
something about boxing, and he evidently knew what was
coming when I started for him, for he put up his hands
in the most approved style. My own hands were still
raw and sore from the encounter in Moore’s house the
day before, and they were almost devoid of flesh on the
knuckles when I got through with the Russian. But I’m
sure I did not mind that; for I left him raw and
bleeding, lying in the corner, his clothes torn and his face
unrecognizable. Even then I only refrained from dragging
him to his feet again for some more because Natalie cried
out in pity. “And that’ll teach you to strike women,
you swine!” I told him at last. But the Russian only
moaned.</p>

<p>Larry went to the bathroom on that floor and came
back with some face towels. We gagged both men with
their own handkerchiefs and neckties, in some novel and
effective way which Larry seemed to have at his
finger-tips. Then we rolled the other fellow out from under the
couch. And we tied the hands of all three of them with
the towels. Larry darted out of the door and down the
stairs, and presently he was back again with some cord,
evidently torn from the curtains on the first floor.</p>

<p>“This’ll kape thim apart, sor,” he observed. And
together we tied the three of them, one on the couch, one
in a chair and one on the bed in the next room. Then I
turned to Natalie.</p>

<p>“Did anybody else hit you?” I asked her grimly.</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” she breathed. “That’s enough, p-please!
Look at your poor hands.” There is a Viking spirit in
every woman, however gently reared; for her eyes were
shining in spite of the pity in them.</p>

<p>“ ’Twas a glorious fight, sor,” breathed the delighted
Larry. “But he’s marked you pretty bad. Come away
now and wash yer face, sor. ’Tis no sight for a lady!”
Then I realized that the man had got home some pretty
fair blows before he went under. He was no coward; I’ll
say that for him.</p>

<p>Natalie followed us into the bathroom. She seemed
quite recovered and insisted upon washing my face for
me, by the light of Larry’s electric torch—a ridiculous
proceeding, none the less sweet for that, and one which
relieved my mind a good deal. She had not been badly
ill-treated if she could recover so quickly.</p>

<p>It was a risk remaining there, but I could not go into
the street covered with blood as I was and the risk had
to be taken. Besides, it did not seem probable that more
of them would turn up that night.</p>

<p>“Tell me everything, Natalie,” I begged, as she bathed
my face and hands.</p>

<p>“That was all, Jack,” she whispered. “They did not
ill-treat me very much. But some one was watching me
every minute and they would not even let me feed
myself. What do you suppose they wanted with me? Do
you think they were going to hold me to ransom? I
haven’t much money. And what happened to Mrs.
Fawcette? Is this her house?”</p>

<p>“Yes, this is her house. She’s in the thing, Natalie.
If I had only been sure, I could have warned you more
fully. But I didn’t like that drugged tea from the start.
Tell me, you say they would not let you feed yourself?”</p>

<p>“No. They kept my hands tied. They said they did
not want me to kill myself with the knife. That scared
me more than anything. Why should I kill myself,
Jack?”</p>

<p>I lowered my eyes to hide the red mist that swam in
them. I found myself aching to get back to the other
two specimens of Russian manhood and give them a dose
of the same medicine. I turned away toward where they
lay and Larry sensed my thought, for he caught at my
arm. “Not now, sor,” he whispered; “we must get the
gyurl out av ut, remember.”</p>

<p>I was ashamed and stood waiting quietly until they
had finished with my face and hands. Then Larry
went out with a muttered word or two about seeing if
the coast was clear. I caught Natalie’s hand in mine
and kissed it. “Thank God, we found you,” I whispered.</p>

<p>There was a thistle-down touch on my hair, and I
looked up to find the lovely parted lips close to mine
and the long lashes slowly sinking over the lovely eyes.</p>

<p>A moment or two later Larry coughed close behind
me. He seemed to be chuckling about something. I
looked at him and he became preternaturally grave.
“ ’Tis time we were goin’, sor,” he remarked.</p>

<p>Together we walked to the head of the stairs, leaving
the light still on in that one room and the three
Russians prone where we had tied them. We dared not
light any of the electric lights in the house, but with the
aid of Larry’s torch we managed to guide Natalie’s feet
until we reached the ground floor.</p>

<p>Here we paused while Larry fumbled with the bolts,
and having, at length, got the door open, stuck out a
cautious head to see if the coast was clear. He came
back to us at last.</p>

<p>“The cyar they come in is gone,” said he, “and there’s
nought in sight but a taxi down in front of that
apartment house. Shall I call it?”</p>

<p>“We’ll walk down to it, Larry,” I told him, and we
sallied forth together.</p>

<p>There was no one in sight in the street as we left the
house, closing the door behind us, but as we drew abreast
of the taxi, a man who had been getting a light from
the driver detached himself from the shadow of the car
and shambled away. I went up to the driver and gave
him Natalie’s address. He stared at me curiously, for I
must have been a pretty sight, but he merely nodded and
signed for us to get in.</p>

<p>“Don’t come with me, Jack,” Natalie whispered; “I’ll
be all right now. I have a key in my pocket still; I just
looked. And you must get home. Why, you might be
arrested!”</p>

<p>This event was a good deal more probable than she
guessed, and I knew it would be wiser, now that she was
out of danger, to let her go alone and get home before
the main streets were also deserted and the police began
to inspect all passers-by. But some instinct made me
hesitate, in spite of the need, on Moore’s account, to keep
my freedom.</p>

<p>“The lady’s roight, sor. They’d be sure to pick you
up in that condition. Sure, I’ll see the lady safe home
mesilf.”</p>

<p>In spite of the wiser instinct, my duty to Moore flooded
my mind again and—I have cursed myself countless
times for it—I agreed, for I knew she would be safe
with Larry, and he was a far better hand than I at
avoiding the police.</p>

<p>I turned and held out my hand to Natalie. “All right,”
I said. “Some day I’ll be able to tell you why it is
better so, Natalie.”</p>

<p>If she was disappointed she did not show it. “That’s
right. And come, please, in the morning, or to-morrow
afternoon.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” I whispered, for I could at least
telephone to her in the morning. I stooped and kissed her
hand. A moment later the door slammed and the taxi
started. A faint “Good-night” floated back to me, and
they were gone.</p>

<p>As the taxi passed down the street, the man who
had been talking to the driver started off at a shambling
run and passed around the corner in the same direction
that the car had taken. I stopped in my tracks for a
moment, wondering. But I could hardly expect to
explain the vagaries of such night prowlers, and anyway
Larry was with her, and there was nothing I could do,
in spite of a sudden vague anxiety at the sight of the
running man. I had to get home the quickest way; for
it was very late already.</p>

<p>Fortunately I found another taxi at the corner and
ten minutes later let myself into my new home. My
thoughts were full of Natalie on the ride, and she still
filled my mind as I opened my bedroom door, switched
on the light and closed the door behind me.</p>

<p>But as I turned back to the room again, the heavy
curtains in front of the window parted once more and a
man stepped into the room. “Hands up, Clayton,” he
said. And I stood like a dunce and stared into the steady
muzzle of a revolver.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="ch15">

<h2>Chapter XV. <br> The Darkest Hour</h2>

<p>“Wait,” said the new-comer after a moment.
“Don’t try anything foolish!” For I had
drawn myself together a little, with the idea
of risking a dash at him. I stood still, my hands above
my head, and waited.</p>

<p>“Around my neck,” the stranger went on quickly, “you
will observe a little gold chain. And hanging from it
there is a tiny golden panther. Have you the mate to
it?”</p>

<p>I stared at him. Then I slowly lowered my hands. “I
have,” I told him.</p>

<p>“Let’s see it!”</p>

<p>My little symbol, which Moore had given me, hung
from a cord around my own neck. I fished inside my
shirt, found it and held it out to him.</p>

<p>He stepped forward and glanced at it. “Good,” he
said, and flung his revolver on my bed. “Now we can
talk.”</p>

<p>I sat down rather weakly. “Who are you, anyway?
And why the hold-up?”</p>

<p>“The Chief sent me to replace Moore,” he answered.
“And as to the hold-up, look at yourself in the glass.
You don’t look much like the Society man I expected
to see.”</p>

<p>I sat still and looked him over for a moment or two.
He was tall and raw-boned and his clothes hung on him
in straight lines, like a flag on a still day. A New
England type, I thought. But the face was cosmopolitan.
It was a long, shrewd face, thin and deeply lined. The
eyes were steel blue and set rather close to a thin,
aquiline nose. But there were whimsical, mirthful lines
radiating away from them, and the mouth held humor and
strength both. A man of devious ways, I thought, but a
good fellow and a good friend probably. I smiled
suddenly.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m damned glad you’ve come, anyway, I’ll tell
you that much. I’ve been about as busy as any man
ought to be for the last three days. And I seem to have
made a pretty thorough mess of things.” I leaned
forward. “What’s your name?”</p>

<p>“Pride,” he answered, and we shook hands gravely.
Then he got up. “The first thing I’m going to do, my
dear Clayton,” he said briskly, “is to dress your hands
and face. You’ll be a nice-looking object for a day or
two, anyway. But if we don’t put something on that
face of yours, you’ll be scarred for life. Besides, the
sooner it heals, the sooner you’ll cease to be a marked
man, eh? For I don’t suppose you got that little lot
climbing trees or hitching behind wagons. So turn out
your medicine chest.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t a thing here,” I told him. “And that can
wait. I want to hear your news and tell you mine.”</p>

<p>He got up, reached for his hat and stalked to the door.
“See you in ten minutes. I’m going out for some
bandages.” And he was gone.</p>

<p>Evidently he was used to having his own way.</p>

<p>He came back presently, though how he got into the
house the first time or the second I have no idea to this
day. But he set nonchalantly to work on me, and while
he dressed and bandaged me up, I told him everything
that had happened to Moore and to myself up to date,
including the rescue of Natalie and the fact that I had
sent Larry home with her.</p>

<p>When I had finished he chuckled in a taking way.
“Guess it’s a good job I held you up, Clayton. My face
would likely be bent up a bit by now, if I’d stepped from
behind that curtain of yours without a gun and without
an introduction, eh? But I think you’ve done some
pretty good work, myself.”</p>

<p>“What’s your news? Has the Department done
anything or discovered anything further?” I asked him.</p>

<p>“You bet we have. And the news is bad. The Chief
told you that this was the biggest thing that the
Department ever tackled. Well, it’s bigger than that. It’s so
damned big, Clayton, that the Chief’s about desperate.”</p>

<p>He lowered his voice to a whisper.</p>

<p>“Why, the ramifications of the thing extend into the
highest circles. And we’re running up against snags and
opposition that set the old man about wild. The fact of
the matter is, the gang has a hold in some way or other
on a lot of people who should be helping us to run them
to earth. He has set the entire Secret Service to work
on it. And to-day,” he paused to let his works sink
in, “he is having a session with the President!”</p>

<p>“Wow,” I said, “it’s as big as that, is it? I know it’s
been a damned sight too big for Moore and me so far.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” he went on, “we’ve accomplished
something. We know that the headquarters of the gang are
here in New York somewhere. And we know something
about their methods. We also know that they’ve
corrupted or intimidated some of the police officials here.
That’s why we daren’t call on the police until we have
something pretty definite to go on!”</p>

<p>“What about their methods?”</p>

<p>“Well, there’s a lot of money back of the organization
for one thing. And money is power wherever officials
can be corrupted, and that’s pretty near everywhere. But
when they get a little higher up they have subtler and
even more effective methods. They deliberately
encourage the use of drugs among people who can help them,
and then, being the only source of supply available, they
dictate about what they please to those people. For you
know what a man with a drug habit will do for some more
of the same.”</p>

<p>“But what’s it all about?” I demanded. “What’s it
all for? And where do they get the money and the
drugs?”</p>

<p>He shook his head. “We don’t know,” he answered.
“We imagine that some one is trying to build up an
immense and hidden power in this country. It may be
that we are dealing with a new form of Bolshevism.
And we know that they must have acquired an immense
amount of money from the sale of drugs to wealthy
addicts of their own making. But nobody knows where
they get the drugs, what the drugs are exactly, or how
they get them into the country.”</p>

<p>“But what about these girls? What have they got to
do with——”</p>

<p>My visitor grinned. “The Chief’s got a novel
hypothesis for that, Clayton. He believes that the girls are
used as decoys in some way. But I don’t think much
of it myself, for he can’t explain why we haven’t found
any of them. You see, up to the time of his
disappearance, Moore sent in regular reports each day on what
you and he had accomplished. There was a lot in those
reports about some wonderful parties or other. And the
Chief has it doped out that the girls are forced to take a
hand in giving these parties. But they couldn’t give
parties like that at the same place more than once or
we’d get to know about it. And if they moved the girls
from place to place, they’d be seen and rescued. I think
he’s off on that. I don’t believe there’s any connection
between the drugs and the girls. But then the Chief is
pretty often right.”</p>

<p>“They could move the girls in closed cars at night
without its being noticed,” I ventured.</p>

<p>“What—thirty-six of them? It would be like a school
treat. And I don’t suppose they’d be any quieter than
a school treat if they saw a chance of freedom.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said I, “this party business is the only thing
I’ve run across that even approaches being a clew, and
I’m going to follow it up until I prove or disprove it.”</p>

<p>Pride nodded. “That’s what the Chief wants you to
do, and that’s what I’m here to help you to do. For my
personal opinions don’t count. But now listen, Clayton.
The Chief wants you to know that he thinks you and he
too have been under-estimating this
thing—under-estimating the skill of the other side. He told me to warn
you particularly not to trust to the ignorance of any of
that bunch of Russians you got mixed up with, without
being pretty sure that you have a card up your sleeve in
case you get caught.”</p>

<p>“I don’t trust them, man. But what can I do? I’ve
got to get to one of those parties. And if they find out
who I am, or know all the time, why I’m out of luck,
that’s all. But I’m not going to let Moore stay in their
hands without trying to follow along and get him out.
You see that, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“I sure do,” he answered. He paused a moment. Then
he reached into his side pocket and brought out two
little articles done up in tissue-paper. “Guess the Chief
thinks a good deal of you, Clayton. Anyhow, he’s sent
you a curiosity that very few operatives are allowed to
carry. This is a ring, fashioned after those which the
gentle and affectionate Borgias were said to employ. You
press it on the inside and a tiny needle sticks out of the
snake’s head in front and does for any one it touches.
It does for them so quickly, too, that they never know
what struck them. The inventor presented it to the
Chief.”</p>

<p>He handed me a curiously carved gold ring, the loop
the body of a snake, and the snake’s head, a cobra’s
spread hood, the crest part of the ring. I took it in a
gingerly fashion. “What on earth does he want me to
do with this?”</p>

<p>“Wear it. And when you get in a tight place, use it.
It is locked now so that it can hurt no one. But
holding it in a flame for two seconds melts the lock. Then,
if you lift that little catch with your thumb and press
the back of the ring, it will kill instantly any one whom
the front of the ring touches. And that’s that.”</p>

<p>“What’s the other little plaything?” I asked him dryly.</p>

<p>He drew a flat steel box about two inches in diameter
from its wrappings and held it between his finger and
thumb like a conjurer. “This, my friends, is one of the
finest, strongest and most reliable steel files ever
produced. It is called ‘the burglar’s friend indeed,’ is packed
in a neat box which will fit any gentleman’s vest pocket,
and is guaranteed for the life of the holder and longer.
I offer it to you for a mere pittance. Namely, your
guarantee not to use it to break out of jail.”</p>

<p>“I won’t pay that much,” I laughed. “Not with the
police after me as they are at present.”</p>

<p>“All right, take it for nothing. Anyhow, I guess we
can prevent your going to jail. The Chief has given you
and me a free hand. And he’ll dope out some way to
help us deal with the police situation. He’s coming to
New York himself.”</p>

<p>“By gad, I wish he would,” I answered. “I’d feel a
lot easier in my mind. I hate to think of Moore.”</p>

<p>“Never mind, we’ll get him out between us,” Pride
answered. “And now I think we’d both better go to bed.
It looks like I’ll have an active day to-morrow, and you
want to get a good rest so that your face will heal up
and you’ll be able to get out and about again.”</p>

<p>“All right. Where are you living?”</p>

<p>“Next door. I’ll be in in the morning. So long!” And
he was gone.</p>

<p>I stowed away the two diverse weapons which the Chief
had sent me, in my pockets where I could lay my hands
on them. Then I went to bed. And I only remember
my head hitting the pillow, for I was dog-tired. Besides,
I was a good deal relieved to have reënforcements
present and on the way. I had already realized, in a vague
way, that the thing I was up against must be pretty huge
and pretty cleverly organized. It was no sort of a
proposition for one man to tackle.</p>

<p>Pride woke me the next morning. He had a paper
with him, and he sat commenting drolly on the news of
the day, while I bathed and ordered my breakfast. My
face and hands were pretty sore that morning and I was
not very good-tempered, but Pride did not seem to mind
that. And presently my own temper improved.</p>

<p>I interrupted his soliloquy finally. “Look here, can’t
we get hold of Captain Peters or somebody and have
this charge against me quashed?” I demanded. “How
can I get out and do anything in these duds and with
the police looking for me?”</p>

<p>He shook his head. “Can’t be done, Clayton. You
see, if we exercise pressure and have you cleared, the
police force are bound to know about it. We know that
some of the officers at least are hand in glove with this
gang, though we don’t know which ones. And then
they’d know at once—the gang, I mean—that you were
either part of the Secret Service or under its
protection.</p>

<p>“Then you’d be a worse marked man than you are
now. You couldn’t do a thing then. For we know
that they have organized an intelligence service that’s
damned near as good as our own. They know every
move we make almost as soon as we make it. We’ve had
ample proof of that, though they don’t know the
details of course. The Chief has his suspicions as to the
leak in the Department and I don’t believe it will last
much longer. But until it stops, clearing you through
the Secret Service would be just about the same as
signing your death-warrant, unless you went right away and
gave the case up entirely, and we don’t want you to do
that.”</p>

<p>“All right,” I answered, making a wry face. “I’ll be
hunter and hunted at the same time for a while longer
then.”</p>

<p>There was a little pause. “By the way, Clayton, have
you called up your man this morning?”</p>

<p>“No, by Jove, I haven’t. Why?”</p>

<p>“Well, this is a so-called afternoon paper, although it’s
only about eleven o’clock now. But I’m surprised they
haven’t any news in it of the return of the girl you
rescued.”</p>

<p>I stared at him. “Why should they?”</p>

<p>“Well, let’s call him up anyway, shall we? I want to
meet him.”</p>

<p>His words made me vaguely anxious, and I dressed
quickly and went downstairs to the ’phone. I called
Larry’s house and asked to speak to Tom O’Dowd.
Evidently it was his landlady at the other end, for the
answer was short and to the point. “He’s not here—and
he ain’t been here sence yestiddy. Nice goings on fer a
respectible house!”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to say he didn’t come home last night?”
I shouted.</p>

<p>“He did not!” the woman shouted back and slammed
up the receiver.</p>

<p>I started back to Pride with a horrible sinking
sensation in the pit of my stomach. It would be too rotten
luck if anything had happened to the two of them on the
way home.</p>

<p>But before I reached my room I turned back to the
telephone and called up Mrs. Trevor’s house, whither I
had directed the taxi with Natalie and Larry. Mrs.
Trevor herself answered the ’phone.</p>

<p>“Hello, Mrs. Trevor. This is Clayton speaking. May
I speak to Miss Van Cleef?” I inquired.</p>

<p>Mrs. Trevor’s voice was at once tearful and resentful.
“Surely, Mr. Clayton, you know that Natalie can’t be
found?”</p>

<p>“My God,” I shouted, “didn’t she get home last
night?”</p>

<p>“She did not. Get home last night? Why, what do
you mean? Have you seen her?”</p>

<p>“Seen her? I should say I have seen her. I——” and
then common sense returned. “But I may have been
mistaken,” I added lamely. It would be a nice state of
affairs if I told Mrs. Trevor about finding Natalie and
started that lady off denouncing Mrs. Fawcette before
our plans were ready.</p>

<p>Mrs. Trevor’s voice was wildly excited now. “Tell me
what you mean, Mr. Clayton. Tell me at once please.
I——”</p>

<p>And then I was inexcusably rude to a lady. I hung
up without a word more. For no matter what I told
the lady, it would only start her off on some tack or other
that would be likely to interfere with our plans. And
Natalie had to be found, and found at once.</p>

<p>As I entered my room, Pride started up from his chair.
“She did not get home at all!” he shouted.</p>

<p>“That’s right,” I answered. “I’ve made a mess of it
again. And this time—I can’t think—I can’t think what
it will mean to her. I—I can’t think about it at all. It
will drive me mad!”</p>

<p>He came over to me at that. “Steady, old man. We’ll
find her again. I have a hunch we’re going to clear up
this whole business in a few days. And then——”</p>

<p>“A few days!” I groaned. “Man, what’s happening to
her now?” I flung myself on the bed. “God, if they’ve
captured her again, those swine! Man, can’t we do
something? Can’t we get in touch with Captain Peters and
have Mrs. Fawcette’s house raided? They may be still
there and we may be able to find out something from
them. Suggest something, will you, for God’s sake!” I
was nearly beside myself. “And what about Larry?” I
shouted. “He’s probably done for by this time. And
I dragged him into this thing.”</p>

<p>“Quiet, old man. Quiet!” Pride came over and put
his hand on my arm. “I’ll tell you what we’ll do. I’ll
take a look around the Fawcette house and see what’s
doing. And I’ll wire the Chief the latest developments.
But for the rest we’ll just have to wait.”</p>

<p>I pulled myself together then. “All right,” I answered
quietly. “Sorry. But I may as well tell you that Miss
Van Cleef is to be my wife, even though she may not
know it yet.”</p>

<p>Pride whistled. Then he got up. “I’ll go now and
see who’s in the house still. I may be able to find out
something.” And he hurried out of the room.</p>

<p>“Don’t run into a trap there,” I called after him. And
then I turned away and fell to pacing the floor, back and
forth, back and forth, to get a grip on myself. But it was
a long time before I could even make an attempt to think
clearly and plan ahead.</p>

<p>It was a weary wait. I had lunch in my room and
in the afternoon tried to sleep a little. But it was no go;
and the afternoon was the longest I have ever spent.
It was well after dark when Pride came back. He stood
in the doorway for a moment, staring at me.</p>

<p>“They got them,” he said bluntly, “both of them.”
He came over and laid his hand on my shoulder. “The
house is empty and Mrs. Fawcette appears to have
skipped. She has told the papers that she is ‘out of
town.’ I traced the taxi and found that it must have
been in the hire of the gang. Probably one of their men
driving it. For a cop on night duty reported a
disturbance and several shots in the Park last night, between
one and two o’clock. And afterwards a taxi shot past
him, going like the wind. He got the number, traced it
and found that no such license had been issued. It was
a black car with an unusually long body.”</p>

<p>“That’s the one,” I answered wearily. I stared at
him. “What on earth shall we do now?”</p>

<p>He swung a chair briskly into place in front of my
table and sat down. “Draw up a chair, light a smoke
and I’ll tell you,” he answered. “For there’s only one
thing, that I can see, left to do.” He held out his hand.
“And cheer up, old man. This is the darkest hour. And
that always comes before the dawn, you know.”</p>

<div class="chapter" id="ch16">

<h2>Chapter XVI. <br> The Final Attempt</h2>

<p>I fumbled for a cigar, keeping my head down so
that he would not see my face, for I was pretty close
to the breaking-point. I sat down opposite him and
waited, shading my face with my hand and trying to fix
my thoughts on what he was about to say. It was hard
to do even that.</p>

<p>“Listen, Clayton,” he said, after a moment or two. “I
went to see what I could find about Miss Van Cleef this
afternoon, because you were so vitally interested. But
I had little hope of learning anything. This gang is much
too cute to leave any traces behind them.</p>

<p>“But in the meantime I have other news for you. I
have received powers from Washington that no police
officer, whatever his other affiliations or sympathies,
would dare ignore or disobey.</p>

<p>“But those powers will only be of use to us when we
learn who the people are against whom we can direct
them. We’ve got to find the headquarters of this gang
and break it up. Individual rescues are all right, of
course, but, as you have seen, they don’t accomplish
much. You see, knowing what she did, the gang <em>had</em> to
recapture Miss Van Cleef, whether they wanted to or
not.</p>

<p>“Now, as I see it,” Pride went on, leaning back in
his chair and stroking a bony chin, “the only clew we
have to the whereabouts of their headquarters is based
on the assumption that these girls are used as decoys. If
that is the case, they are probably located in the house
where these orgies are given. That means a big house
and big parties, several of them. And that means
publicity—in town.”</p>

<p>I started up. “You mean that the headquarters is
somewhere out of town?”</p>

<p>“Exactly,” he nodded. “They could not give more
than one or, at most, two parties of that nature and on
such a scale without the police and the newspapers
getting wind of it.”</p>

<p>“Well, then——”</p>

<p>“Well, then, it means that if we searched or
investigated all the houses of any size near New York which
are within the radius of a two-hour run in a
high-powered car, we would be at the job for months, we would
warn them well in advance and they would skip and set
up their establishment elsewhere.”</p>

<p>“They would have to take the girls with them.”</p>

<p>Pride dropped his eyes. “Not necessarily,” he said,
in a low voice. “They could get more.”</p>

<p>I felt as though I were struggling in the grip of a
nightmare. “My God! do you mean—murder?”</p>

<p>Pride gave an impatient gesture. “How can I tell,
man? This is a big gang and a fearless one—and
utterly unscrupulous. They are after power, it seems.
They have a lot of it now. And they might not let a
thing like that stop them.”</p>

<p>I got up and began to pace the floor. “Well, then,” I
demanded childishly, “what are we going to do about it?
What are we going to do about it?” The helpless
feeling of the early months of my search returned, magnified
a hundred times. “My God, what kind of a Secret
Service and police force have we got, anyway!”</p>

<p>Pride hesitated. “That’s not quite fair, Clayton,” he
answered at last, gravely. “We’ve done some pretty
good work in the past. But we are working under the
disadvantage of a certain amount of publicity. The
gang got at one of our members or more and learned
all about us long before we knew they existed. And
we’re trying to find them, not they us.”</p>

<p>“I know,” I answered, dropping into a chair. “I beg
your pardon. I had no business to say that. But these
last weeks—and now to-day——”</p>

<p>“That’s all right. I don’t blame you.” Pride paused
a moment. “But here’s what I’m getting at. If we can
locate this gang we can round them up and run them in
without any formality. And if we get them we’ll keep
them. But we’ve got to find them first. And the only
way I can think of to find them is to get taken to one
of their parties.”</p>

<p>I laughed. “We’ve tried that,” I said.</p>

<p>“We’ve got to try it again, then.”</p>

<p>“How?” I demanded.</p>

<p>Pride leaned forward. “You got pretty thick with that
Russian, Ivanovitch, wasn’t it, who served that doped
tea?”</p>

<p>“I tried to, but I don’t know how well it worked.”</p>

<p>“Is there anything to connect you in his mind with
the Department? Was he at Mrs. Fawcette’s the day
Miss Van Cleef was captured?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I think so.”</p>

<p>“Was he one of the men who turned up when you
rescued her?”</p>

<p>“No, he wasn’t!”</p>

<p>“Do you think the men who came that night
recognized you?”</p>

<p>“I don’t see how they could. They might have
described me to Mrs. Fawcette or Ivanovitch himself,
however.”</p>

<p>“Well,” Pride answered, “it’s only a chance, of course.
But if Ivanovitch is hand in glove with Mrs. Fawcette
and Vining, he’ll know about their having you arrested.
So, if you go to see him, he’ll probably try again to have
you arrested. If he doesn’t do that, it’s a fair
presumption that he does not suspect you. Then you can try
to get him to take you on one of the parties. I’ll have
you followed, adequately this time, and follow you
myself. It will be pretty poor work if they give us the
slip again.”</p>

<p>“Well,” I said, “I’ll try it. I’ll try anything. You
can be sure of that. But can’t you have these birds
followed anyway? Has Vining been followed, shadowed all
the time? And Ivanovitch? And Mrs. Fawcette?”</p>

<p>Pride smiled. “Followed! I should say they have.
But we’ve had to use police plain-clothes men. They
lost track of both Vining and Mrs. Fawcette the day
Moore was captured. Since then I’ve called off the man
I had watching Ivanovitch because I did not want him
to know that he was under suspicion and they’re too
clever for these plain-clothes men.”</p>

<p>“Well, isn’t there any one else suspected? Isn’t there
any one else we could follow?” And suddenly I
remembered the little book I had found in Vining’s desk. I had
left it under the blotter on my table. “Look here, I have
something, I think!” and I told him about that little book
and the names in it.</p>

<p>When I had finished, Pride gave me a droll look. “Is
there any other little detail you have omitted to
mention?” he asked dryly. “That book may be absolutely
invaluable to us. What was in it exactly?”</p>

<p>I told him of the names and the numbers after them.
“What could they mean?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Might mean anything. Members and dues, perhaps,
in some club. But the names themselves would tell us
something. Where is the book?”</p>

<p>I told him and received another droll look. “Well, if
there was anything important in it, you don’t suppose
it’s there now, do you?” he asked. “But I’ll get in there
and see. I’ve got to get into your apartment anyway.”</p>

<p>“What for? Oh, for my clothes, of course.”</p>

<p>“Exactly. You can’t call on Ivanovitch in those duds.”</p>

<p>I got up again. “When do I go to see him?” I
demanded.</p>

<p>“Why not drop in to-morrow afternoon? That will
give me time to get your clothes and to plant a man in
the house perhaps. At any rate it will give me time to
arrange about having you closely followed. Wait—I’ll
drive you there myself. The car has been loaned you by
a friend who is out of town and I’m your friend’s
chauffeur. That is, if he asks. What do you think of that
plan?”</p>

<p>“Oh, it sounds all right,” I answered. “It’s action,
anyway. But I wish I could get my hands on those brutes.”</p>

<p>Pride smiled and was silent for a moment. Then he
glanced up suddenly. “Look here, Clayton,” he said,
“I’m going to play fair with you. I think we’ve been
underestimating this gang all along. I think any such
attempt as this would be underestimating them. But I’m
banking on one thing. I’m banking on my own powers to
trace you. For I think it’s quite possible that he’ll take
you with him on a party if you ask him to. But not
because he does not suspect you. I think he and the rest
of the gang know all about you. But I also think that
they underestimate us. And I think that they are afraid
of you as long as you are at liberty.”</p>

<p>I stared at him in amazement. “But then what’s the
use of my going there?”</p>

<p>“Because, as I say, I think he’ll play his wits against
ours. I think, for the sake of getting you under lock and
key, in their hands, he’ll try to kidnap you, ostensibly to
go on a party, and trust to shaking off any pursuit you
may have arranged.”</p>

<p>I whistled. “Oh, that’s what you’ve had up your
sleeve. I’m to be the bait, eh?”</p>

<p>He nodded gravely. “That’s it exactly, Clayton.”</p>

<p>“Well,” I laughed, “if he agrees to take me, it’s up to
you! But, by gad, I’d be glad to go anyway. If I ever
get to their hang-out and get loose, I’ll make things warm
for them.”</p>

<p>Pride rose to his feet. “That’s what we’ve been doing
all along—what you’re doing when you say that. You’re
not giving them credit for much brains and they’ve got
plenty. Look at the way they had Miss Van Cleef
guarded and the arrangements for calling for help. It
wasn’t long in coming either. No, if they get you there,
you won’t be in any condition to do much damage. Be
sure of that.”</p>

<p>“Unless I can make them underestimate me. They
ought to have a pretty poor opinion of me now, after the
mess I’ve made of things.”</p>

<p>Pride laughed. “Well, I’m going up to your place
now. You’d better go to bed and get a good night’s rest.
Your face isn’t anything to look at yet. But it will be
better in the morning and your head is about healed.”
He opened the door. “Good-night and don’t worry. I’ll
see you in the morning.” Then he went out.</p>

<p>I spent the rest of the evening up to midnight
alternately sitting down and trying to read or walking the
floor. Before I went to bed I put some stuff Pride had
brought me on my face and hands. It had wonderful
healing qualities and I was already beginning to look
more like a human being, so that I hoped to look at least
respectable by morning.</p>

<p>True to his promise, Pride turned up after breakfast
the next morning. He was carrying a suit-case, which
he flung on my bed. He grinned at me and banged down
into one of the landlady’s plush horrors with which my
room was furnished.</p>

<p>“There’s your clothes, my lad. And a sweet time I had
getting them. There’s a cop still in charge of your
apartment, and the landlord up there is nearly crazy because
all of his tenants are leaving on account of the disgrace.
The cop put up an argument about my taking your things,
and I did not want to tell him who I am because Lord
knows he may be hand in glove with these birds. But I
got Captain Peters on the wire finally, and the poor cop
fairly groveled. But—your little book is strangely
missing.” He treated me to another of his droll glances. “I
dare say your friend Mrs. Fawcette got away with that
too, along with your card-case.”</p>

<p>“All right,” I told him. “Don’t rub it in. What’s the
program now?”</p>

<p>“Well,” he answered, “here’s my idea. I’m going out
presently to hire a big car. I’m not going to get it from
the Police Department of course, because they would spot
the license. Then I’ll take your suit-case with me and
pick you up near by here.</p>

<p>“It will be a closed car and you will have to contrive
to change your clothes on the way, because you can’t
call on Ivanovitch in those duds, and you can’t walk out
of this house in your good ones. It would give the
landlady heart failure.</p>

<p>“When you’ve changed, I’ll drive you to his house, and
you can make a casual call and broach the subject of a
party. I’ll wait outside for you, and you can tell him
that the car belongs to a friend who has gone out of town
and lent it to you while he’s away.”</p>

<p>I assented, and we left it at that. The rest of the
morning and over our lunch we discussed the best method
of supplying additional tracers, in case Ivanovitch agreed
to take me and Pride failed to follow the car we went
in. Pride decided to have two police cars in readiness
and a couple of motorcycle cops also, to make doubly
sure.</p>

<p>As the time approached for us to start, I felt my spirits
rising a little with the thought of action. And when at
last I was struggling to change into a stiff shirt and a
frock-coat in the confines of Pride’s hired limousine,
kneeling on the floor most of the time, I began to feel
nearly normal again, in spite of a terrible anxiety about
Natalie and Moore and Larry.</p>

<p>I was ready, with my workman’s clothes neatly packed
in the suit-case and the latter under the seat, by the time
we reached the house of Ivanovitch. Pride was driving
himself and was attired in the usual chauffeur’s livery.
He pulled up nearly in front of the house and even got
down and opened the door for me. “Good luck!” he
whispered as I mounted the steps.</p>

<p>To my delight, Ivanovitch’s slant-eyed servant told me
that his master was at home and he would inquire whether
he was disengaged. A moment later he was back again.
“Walk after me, sar. My master will look at you.”</p>

<p>“I’ll bet he will!” I thought, and followed the Jap
or whatever he was. A moment after he left,
Ivanovitch appeared.</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Clayton! This is charming of you! I
have thought of you so often lately” (I grinned to
myself, staring at him), “and wondered what had become
of you! I have been intending to try to locate you!”</p>

<p>Could all this be coincidence? I wondered. Or was
the man laughing at me? It was impossible to tell from
his glittering and quite meaningless smile.</p>

<p>“That’s mighty nice of you!” I told him. “But if you
tried to find me,” I added, laughing, “you did not
succeed very well.” I saw no reason why two could not
play at the game of double meanings.</p>

<p>He shook his head. “No, but this is even better, you
see. For you have come to me!”</p>

<p>He had me there. “Yes,” I answered, “I have been
bored with a lot of irritating details of which life seems
to be made up nowadays, and I thought of you at once
as an antidote. So here I am!”</p>

<p>He bowed. “As kind as ever! Let me give you a
cocktail, shall I? I have something rather special which
I think will surprise you.”</p>

<p>If this was meant to get me to display hesitation about
accepting his booze, it failed. “I don’t know anything
I’d like better,” I answered, “if you’ll join me. I can’t
have you bothering to mix a drink for me alone.”</p>

<p>He gave me a swift, noncommittal glance. “But of
course I’ll join you,” he answered, and went away to
mix the drinks.</p>

<p>When he returned, we fell into an animated
conversation over the cocktails, which were excellent, and
presently he asked me of his own volition whether I had
found anything like the type of entertainment in which
I had expressed an interest to him.</p>

<p>“Not a thing,” I told him. “And, frankly, that’s a
minor reason for looking you up again. I hoped you
might have heard of something new and amusing, such
as this modern Baghdad ought to offer, if one could
only find it.”</p>

<p>He laughed. “Your coming to me to-day is certainly
a coincidence, my friend. For I am going to just such
an entertainment this very night.”</p>

<p>I leaned forward eagerly. “Can you take me with
you?” I urged. “I assure you, you will save my life
if you do!”</p>

<p>“Hardly that,” he laughed, shaking his head. “But
of course I can take you, if you have the—er—price, as
I think you call it. The admission fee is 200 dollars.”</p>

<p>“Phew!” I whistled. “Is that a season ticket?”</p>

<p>“No, that is for one evening. And I think you will
find,” he added, turning away to the tray, “that one
evening will go a long way. Everything else will seem tame
to you afterwards.”</p>

<p>I thought that the conversation was taking a distinctly
gruesome tone; but of course I did not tell him so. “I
must go home and dress then,” I told him. “What time
do we start and where do I meet you?”</p>

<p>He laughed again. “Come, come, there is no need
to dress, I am going as I am. We have a long drive
ahead of us, and we shall have to start in an hour at
the latest. Besides that, I am not going to let you leave
again, now that you have come at last!”</p>

<p>I swallowed that too. “All right. If you’re sure it’s
all right to go like this. But I have not that much money
on me. I’ll have to go and cash a check.”</p>

<p>“Give me your check and I shall pay for your
admission. That will be all right, my friend. And now let us
talk about Europe. I am sick to death of the crudity of
this country and it is a real pleasure to talk with one who
has traveled and knows other countries also. Do you not
find your country crude?”</p>

<p>I assured him heartily that my country bored me to
death, lacking as it did any really artistic preception
of the refined possibilities of vice. And we went on like
that for some time. But presently it began to get dark
outside. I got up, went to his desk and drew him a
personal check for 200 dollars. He took it, rose and rang
for his servant.</p>

<p>“Get the car ready, Niko,” he told the Jap, “and see
that it has plenty of gas. I shall drive it myself to-night.
This gentleman is going with me.”</p>

<p>The servant glanced at me impassively. “Very well,
sar,” he told his master and vanished, silently.</p>

<p>“Wait a minute,” I ventured. “I have a car out here
myself. Why not go in mine? It is comfortable, fully
enclosed and has plenty of gasoline.”</p>

<p>Ivanovitch shook his head, smiling his meaningless
smile. “You do not understand, my friend,” he
answered. “I must take you in a special car. There is
much secrecy about this club; except to members the
whereabouts of it are quite unknown. And as the type of
entertainment is not exactly approved by the laws of your
country, they must remain unknown. No, I shall be
obliged to insist upon your accepting the hospitality of
my car.” He paused and walked to the window. “And
as you will not need your car, you will wish to dismiss it,
<i>n’est-ce pas</i>? I shall send Niko.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t trouble,” I answered casually; “I have
some instructions to give the driver. I’ll tell him now.”
And I walked into the hall.</p>

<p>But when I had the front door open, I found
Ivanovitch at my side. And he proceeded to accompany me
down the steps to where Pride was sitting in full regalia in
the hired limousine.</p>

<p>“How charming is the evening air,” Ivanovitch observed
suavely.</p>

<p>“Tom,” I said pleasantly, as we came up to Pride,
“this gentleman is taking me for a ride to-night, so I
won’t need you any longer. I should be glad if you would
see my man before you go home and tell him to get the
place cleaned up, and,” I laughed, “to follow my
instructions a little more closely this time. Tell him, too, that I
shall probably not be home to-night!” I turned to
Ivanovitch for confirmation and he nodded.</p>

<p>“Tell him to expect you when he sees you,” he laughed.</p>

<p>I was beginning to dislike Ivanovitch.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="ch17">

<h2>Chapter XVII. <br> Walk into My Parlor</h2>

<p>Ivanovitch had been looking at the so-called Tom,
but he turned away and Pride gave him a swift,
comprehensive look. He turned to me.</p>

<p>“Excuse me, sir, but you spoke of seeing Mr. Jenkins
to-day, sir. Something about an option?”</p>

<p>“By Jove, yes,” I answered, wondering what on earth
Pride had in mind. “I’ll have to take that up before I
leave.” I turned to Ivanovitch. “It’s a little matter of
business that I can attend to in half an hour. Will that
delay you too much?”</p>

<p>I could see that the Russian did not like it, but he
could not say so. “If you must, you must,” he answered.
“But we should be starting now. You will be as quick as
possible?”</p>

<p>“I certainly will,” I answered gayly. “I would not
miss this for all the real estate in the world.”</p>

<p>I jumped into the car. “Make for Times Square, Tom,”
I directed Pride. “Back in half an hour or less,
Ivanovitch.”</p>

<p>Ivanovitch nodded a little glumly as Pride slipped in
the clutch. “Very well,” he called after us.</p>

<p>Pride tore around a couple of corners and pulled up
in front of a drug store. Then he jumped down and
opened the door of the car like a man in a hurry. “Man,
man, I’ve got some quick telephoning to do. Damn it,
we may not be able to get what we need from the police
in so short a time. I’m going in to telephone now. In
the meantime, have you got that ring and that file?”</p>

<p>I struck my forehead with my open palm. “I
certainly belong to the Sherlock Holmes class,” I told him.
“They are in my other clothes in the bag.”</p>

<p>Pride laughed. “Well, hurry up and get them out
while I’m telephoning. I don’t want to wait here too
long, after what you said about Times Square. He might
stroll around here.”</p>

<p>I got the bag out from under the seat, found the ring
and file and slipped the former on my finger and the little
box containing the latter into a handy pocket. But after
the bag was packed and stowed away again and all neat
and tidy, I lit a match and held my deadly ring so that
the snake’s head was in the flame for three or four
seconds.</p>

<p>It was some time before Pride appeared. And when
he did come out, it was with a very long face. He came
up and opened the door of the car, as though asking for
orders.</p>

<p>“Hell,” he said softly; “it took me nearly twenty
minutes to locate Peters, and he cannot get more than
one motor-bike cop up here in the time. He’s going to
try to get a police car stationed near the house to pick
you up also, but he seemed doubtful. We’d better get
back anyhow. I’ll probably be able to follow you
myself.”</p>

<p>“All right,” I answered; “but the Russian is wise
to us, I think. He knows, or else there’s an awful lot of
coincidence in most of his remarks. Never mind. We’ve
got to find the place, and this is a chance.”</p>

<p>Pride jumped into the driving seat, and a few moments
later we were back in front of the Russian’s house. As
he opened the car door for me he asked: “You haven’t
got a gun on you, have you?”</p>

<p>I told him I hadn’t.</p>

<p>“That’s right. It will only be taken away from you
and it would simply confirm their suspicions. Now good
luck, old man. The die is cast.”</p>

<p>A horn tooted softly just behind us and we turned.
A big limousine was waiting to get in front of the door.
The man driving it was Niko, Ivanovitch’s servant.
Pride jumped into the driving seat of our car and pulled
away at once, saluting without another word. I turned
and went up to the door.</p>

<p>Ivanovitch himself let me in. “Ah, you’re back again
in time. I’m glad; for I should have had to go without
you. However, I’ve telephoned about you, and they are
expecting you. Now let us go, shall we?”</p>

<p>“Expecting me, are they?” I thought. “That makes it
nice.”</p>

<p>Ivanovitch picked up his coat and hat from a chair
and held the front door open for me, and together we
went down to the car. Niko had disappeared, but,
to my surprise, another man sat in the driving seat.
Naturally I looked him over pretty sharply. And then I
started in my turn, For the face of Ivanovitch’s new
driver was quite familiar to me. He was one of the two
men who had been with Vining the day he caught me
burgling his flat!</p>

<p>A wave of feeling went through me as I stepped into
the car. It was compounded of hope and delight. I
hoped the man would not recognize me because of the
mask I wore that night. But I was tremendously elated.
For here was final proof positive that I was on the right
track. Vining and Ivanovitch, Mrs. Fawcette and the
rest of the bunch of Russians were all in the same gang
then. And the orgies of Vining’s stories to Moore must
be the orgies of Ivanovitch’s stories to me. At last I was
on my way to the headquarters of the gang.</p>

<p>Ivanovitch stepped in after me and closed the door.
As he sat down beside me he laughed softly. “I thought
afterwards that it would be so dull for us both if I drove,”
he observed. “So I sent for the chauffeur after all. You
see, some one would have to ride with you anyway, to be
sure you did not look out to find how and whither we were
going.”</p>

<p>“What a mystery!” I laughed. “It’s like the <i>Arabian
Nights</i>.”</p>

<p>“Ye‑es,” he drawled; “quite like, indeed.”</p>

<p>The car started smoothly away from the curb, and
Ivanovitch leaned forward and pressed a button half
concealed by the rug rack. To my amazement, shutters
tolled silently up over all the windows and we were in
total darkness. A moment later an electric globe flashed
on overhead and I turned to find the amused eyes of my
guide on me. “Neat, isn’t it?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“But it is all marvelous,” I answered in a delighted
tone. “Judging by the efficiency of your preparations,
these must be a wonderful lot of evenings. How long a
drive is it, if you can tell me so much?”</p>

<p>He shook his head, smiling still. “Not even that, my
friend. I am sure you would not give us away; but you
see we make a rule to trust no one, and we stick to it.
It’s a pretty good plan, don’t you think so?”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed,” I answered. “But then you must be
one of the organizers or officers or charter members, or
whatever you call it?”</p>

<p>Ivanovitch did not seem to take to that question. At
all events he did not answer it. And we drove along
for some time after that in silence. Presently, however,
he started another topic of conversation and we chatted
pleasantly enough.</p>

<p>From the very start I had done my best to get a
general idea of the direction we were taking by noting the
corners we had turned indicated by the swaying of the
car this way or that. It seemed to me that we were going
east and south. But owing to stops and very gentle starts
which might have been turns to left or right, I could not
be certain. Besides, I had to pay some attention to what
I was saying to my host. He grew more animated as we
talked, and kept me busy making intelligent replies. It
almost seemed as though he wanted to prevent me from
taking any note of our progress.</p>

<p>I did notice one thing, however. In the course of our
tide, there came a hollow quality in the sound of the traffic
round us at about the same time that we began to pull up
along grade. This continued until we had topped it and
dropped down a decline of about the same length, as near
as I could tell. And I knew what that meant. It meant
that we had crossed one of the bridges over the East
River and were passing through Brooklyn.</p>

<p>But there, as one generally does in Brooklyn, I lost
finally my sense of direction altogether and turned my
attention entirely to Ivanovitch.</p>

<p>He talked on agreeably for half an hour or so. By
this time I noticed that practically all sounds of traffic
had ceased. The car we were in was a powerful one and
very silent running, so that it was easy to detect the sound
of any passing vehicle.</p>

<p>A little later, Ivanovitch gave me a swift but fleeting
glance and leaned forward, taking a speaking tube from
its hook. He spoke into it for a moment or two, and I
cursed my ignorance of Russian. But the car
immediately slowed up a good deal and we rode along almost
silently.</p>

<p>“Please do not talk now,” Ivanovitch said to me.
“You see, there is always the danger of being followed,
and this necessitates taking certain precautions, So
we will listen for a time, if you don’t mind.”</p>

<p>He reached up and opened a little shuttered window
in the back of the tonneau. First he looked out and then
he turned his head sideways to listen.</p>

<p>I was in a fever of excitement. All through the ride
I had been playing, in the back of my mind, with the
thought of seeing Natalie again, of finding Moore and
Larry, and possibly even finding and rescuing my little
sister. But now at this new move my mind flew to Pride
and the importance of his successful pursuit; for I had
not the slightest idea where we were. And in the bottom
of my heart I was satisfied now that Ivanovitch knew who
I was and was simply taking me to this party to get me
into safe hands. It had all been too easy. Therefore the
only hope lay in Pride being able to trace me successfully
and get me out of it along with the others. For I had
little confidence in my chances of getting out of it by
myself, once they had me there in their hands and
probably badly outnumbered.</p>

<p>I got up silently back of my host and managed to
catch a glimpse out of the corner of the open window
over his head. But it was pitch dark outside now. There
were no street lights where we were, and I could see
nothing at all. “Anybody there?” I whispered, and tried
to edge Ivanovitch away from the window.</p>

<p>He turned swiftly and shut the window. “My friend,”
he said in his even tone, “you will be entirely silent, if
you please. And do not attempt to look out of the
window again, eh?”</p>

<p>Something touched me and I looked down. The
Russian’s hand held a small nickel-plated revolver, and the
muzzle of it was nosing the lowest button of my vest.
“Sorry,” he added, smiling, “but we must take
precautions, you see. You will be careful?”</p>

<p>I laughed. “Well, this is getting to be a melodrama
all of a sudden, isn’t it? All right. Don’t shoot. I’ll
be good.”</p>

<p>At my first word the Russian’s face lost its mask of
good-humor for the first time. The lips drew back from
even white teeth and the eyes narrowed into a vicious
scowl. “You will be good—and silent,” he observed.
“Not another word!”</p>

<p>I let my mouth sag open, staring at him in simulated
amazement. But the man’s cold eye had killing in it,
and I did not venture to speak again. He turned away,
opened the little window again and put his ear to it. He
listened for a long minute. Then he clapped the window
shut and took up the speaking tube. For some reason,
probably to annoy me, he spoke in English this time.</p>

<p>“Alexandre! We are being followed. Give the
signal!”</p>

<p>Then he leaned back again, stowed away his revolver
and turned to me with his former cold smile.</p>

<p>“I must apologize, my dear Clayton, for being a little
insistent,” he said, his eyes full of malicious amusement.
“But, you see, we have to take precautions, and as
long as you talked I could not hear. However, our
friends back there have a little surprise in store for them
that will probably discourage them for some time. So we
can now resume our pleasant conversation.”</p>

<p>“I confess,” I answered lightly, “that your manner
of asking for silence seemed a little abrupt, but it was
certainly efficient. Of course, if I had realized what you
wanted, I would have been silent without all that display
of force.” I tried to seem startled and aggrieved rather
than resentful.</p>

<p>To some extent I think it worked, for he looked at
me curiously, with a shadow of doubt in his eyes. But
he visibly swept it aside a moment later and began to talk
again.</p>

<p>For my part, while I listened to him with half an
ear, I was listening as keenly as I could for any evidence
of pursuit. Nothing happened for several moments,
however, and I was just beginning to wonder whether
the whole thing had been planned by him to see whether
I knew of any pursuit and would rise to the bait, when
the chauffeur suddenly blew three long melancholy blasts
on his Klaxon. A moment later he repeated the signal.</p>

<p>I found Ivanovitch staring at me keenly. I looked
back at him in inquiry. “Is that the signal?” I
whispered.</p>

<p>“That is the signal. Presently you shall see an
example of efficient organization.”</p>

<p>The Klaxon signal blew again at this moment, and
the driver kept it up at regular intervals for perhaps
five minutes. But presently the usual interval passed
without a signal, and instantly Ivanovitch opened the
rear window and seized my arm.</p>

<p>“Come and see,” he said, his voice exultant and
vicious.</p>

<p>I went to the window and looked back into the
darkness. I could make out the faint sound of another car
following ours.</p>

<p>And as I watched there came a sudden blinding flash
in the road only some twenty yards behind us followed
by a deafening roar.</p>

<p>We must have passed over the spot only a few seconds
before. The explosion was followed by the screech of
brakes hastily applied. But they were not applied quickly
enough, for as our own car quickened its speed, I heard
another clanging crash behind us. It was evident that
we had been outwitted again.</p>

<p>I turned to find Ivanovitch’s ironical eyes on me.</p>

<p>“Pretty neat, eh?” he inquired. “Whoever our friends
are there behind us, they will not follow us again in a
hurry, do you think so?”</p>

<p>I pulled myself together and tried to push out of my
mind the thought of Pride lying back there in the road,
maimed and bleeding.</p>

<p>“But great Scott,” I cried, “what did you do? Blow
up the road?”</p>

<p>“Exactly.”</p>

<p>“But people will find the hole in the road and
investigate? And they will find the wrecked car and the people
in it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no!” Ivanovitch shook his head. “They will
find neither one nor the other, my friend. There is a
very capable gang of men back there where that
explosion took place. In an hour they will have the
occupants of the car in a safe place, the car itself out of the
way and the road mended—for it is only a dirt road, you
know.”</p>

<p>He took out his cigarette case, offered me a cigarette,
and when I refused it, took one himself and lit it with
a perfectly steady hand. “People who interfere with
us,” he remarked, blowing a cloud of smoke into the air,
“do so at their peril, my friend.”</p>

<p>“I agree with you perfectly,” I laughed. “Why, I had
no idea such things happened in this day and age.” I
paused. “But I hope those people who were following us
did not have any other cards up their sleeves!”</p>

<p>The Russian’s head came round with a jerk and he
stared at me for a long moment before he answered.
“What other cards could they have?” he asked at last,
and I did not like the silky tone of his voice at all.</p>

<p>“I’m blessed if I know,” I laughed. “But that was
pretty close to murder back there, and the sensation of
aiding and abetting a murder is a new one to me.” I
caught his eye. “I imagine it takes a while to get used
to it, eh?”</p>

<p>I saw the angry veins swelling on the man’s forehead,
and for a moment I regretted taunting him. I had plenty
of enemies as it was. But his voice was even enough
when he answered. “I don’t suppose he was hurt much,”
he said, “and he should have been minding his own
business instead of following us.”</p>

<p>His use of the singular in speaking of the occupant of
the wrecked car took my breath away for a moment.
Either it was a queer coincidence or the man was
uncanny. I tried to pull myself together and ask him a
question about how the road had been blown up, but
before I could do so, the driver blew four short blasts on his
Klaxon and the car began to slow up. Ivanovitch turned
on me.</p>

<p>“If you will turn your back,” he said, “I will
blindfold you and tie your hands behind you. The one is
necessary to prevent your seeing where you are—the
other to prevent your lifting the bandage. You will be
freed as soon as you are inside.”</p>

<p>For a moment I had a wild impulse to spring on him
and throttle him; for I felt the toils closing on me. But
an instant’s reflection convinced me that such a move
would be the worst kind of a mistake. There was
probably plenty of help within call and we might be found
any moment. The only thing was to submit and with
as good a grace as possible.</p>

<p>I laughed and turned my back to him at once, putting
my hands behind me.</p>

<p>“Go ahead,” I said.</p>

<p>Ivanovitch gave a dry chuckle, the first time I had
heard him laugh at all, and tied my hands very swiftly.
A moment later a silk handkerchief covered my eyes and
was drawn tight. I was quite helpless.</p>

<p>I felt the car stop and heard some one open the door.
“This way,” said Ivanovitch, and I stepped out.
Judging by the freshness of the air we were well out into the
country and somewhere quite close to the sea, for the
tang of it was strong.</p>

<p>Some one took my arm on either side, and I stumbled
forward for perhaps a hundred yards over what I took
to be a dirt road. But in a little our footsteps began to
echo and I knew that we were under cover. There was
a strong smell of gasoline and oil now—so strong that
I would have been willing to swear that we were in a
garage. And, judging by the echo of our footsteps, the
building was quite a large one. On the way I was
conscious of swift and gentle hands touching me lightly here
and there, and I smiled grimly, remembering Pride’s
remark about carrying a gun.</p>

<p>My guides slowed up presently, and I stepped down a
little. Then I was led to a seat. A moment later a door
banged and we began to descend.</p>

<p>I felt exactly as though I were in a nightmare. I knew
that I had come out of the car on to the level ground. We
had got into what was obviously an elevator, and yet
the thing was going down instead of up. Of that I was
certain. Moreover, my guides were entirely silent, and
it was an eerie sensation to know myself helpless in the
hands of my enemies, and wait blind and tied for their
first move.</p>

<p>The air grew damper and damper, with the queer
moldy smell of vaults and tunnels below ground. But
after perhaps two minutes of very gradual descent the
elevator stopped and I was led out.</p>

<p>And now came the queerest thing of all; for I was
guided up to a step, lifted over it and placed in another
seat, and then, with a gruff word from Ivanovitch, found
myself moving, horizontally this time and at a
considerable rate of speed. The same damp moldy air blew in
my face now, so that I was certain that we were still well
under ground. But the trip went on and on for at least
five minutes and the little car—for it swayed enough to
show me that it was small—still kept up a good speed.
The crackle of a spark and a brilliant light through my
bandage told me that it was electrically driven.</p>

<p>When we did stop at last I was completely bewildered.
But I had sense enough to keep my ears open still, so
that I was fully aware of being guided into another
elevator and shot upward again—this time much more
quickly, or so it seemed.</p>

<p>And presently the elevator stopped, I walked for a
few yards and halted again. I heard Ivanovitch speak
in a low voice and heard the sound of shuffling feet
retreating. Then some one fumbled with the cords at my
wrists and in a moment I was free.</p>

<p>“You can remove the bandage now,” I heard
Ivanovitch say, and with a great surge of relief I raised my
hands and swept the blindfold from my eyes.</p>

<h2>Chapter XVIII. <br> When in Rome——</h2>

<p>When my eyes had grown accustomed to the soft
glow of electric lights, I saw that I stood, alone
with Ivanovitch, in a small room delicately
furnished in blue and gold. A gilded iron grille behind my
guide showed where the elevator had descended again.
The Russian’s eyes were fixed on me in an amused
inquiry.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said presently, “shall we proceed?”</p>

<p>“We have arrived then?” I inquired. “What a
beautiful room!”</p>

<p>“Yes, we have arrived. But this is just an anteroom.
Now you must tell me how you would prefer to spend
the evening.”</p>

<p>“Spend the evening?”</p>

<p>“Exactly. There are rooms devoted to the god of
chance, which I think you will find amusing—and
unusual. There is an entertainment, which we might call
a play, although it differs from any stage production
that you have seen in the West. There is a banquet, with
viands and wines which I think you will find strikingly
unusual, and there are—the gardens.”</p>

<p>I stared at him. “Man, how can I tell?” I demanded.
For so many entertainments meant a greatly decreased
chance of finding Natalie or Margaret. “Won’t you
be my guide? I am sure that anything which you
recommend will be well worth seeing.”</p>

<p>“Seeing?” laughed Ivanovitch. “We appeal to all the
senses, my friend.” He looked at me amusedly. “But
I think that the banquet is Roman to-night and I believe
that a good deal of pains has been taken with it. If I
might make a suggestion, I should say, go to the
banquet first and then, if you are not too sleepy”—he
broke off, laughing—“go to the entertainment or to the
gardens, unless you are fond of gambling. You must
be hungry by now, anyway.”</p>

<p>“The banquet by all means then!” I laughed. “And
afterwards——”</p>

<p>“What you will,” Ivanovitch interrupted. “But let
me make one little point clear to you before we part for
the present. You will meet and talk with beautiful
women, probably. It is possible that their costumes
might lead you to jump to conclusions which would be
entirely erroneous. They are young ladies and are to be
treated as such.”</p>

<p>I bowed to hide the joy in my eyes. Who could
these beautiful young ladies be, if not the girls who had
disappeared of late? And if they were so treated,
perhaps no harm had come to Natalie and Margaret.</p>

<p>I looked up to find his eyes fixed on me intently.
“As to the gardens,” he went on, “that is another
matter altogether. After the banquet you can go to the
gardens and sport with the—nymphs—if you wish. And
in the gardens, restrictions on the guests
are—conspicuous by their absence. You see,” he added, in a drawl,
“the young lady attendants here are—er—given garden
duty, so to speak, when they do anything, or attempt to
do anything, displeasing to the management. So—most
of them behave.”</p>

<p>Some saving sense told me that his words were in the
nature of a taunt, intending to enrage me and make me
disclose my hostility. So I turned away to hide my anger
and glanced about the room appreciatively.</p>

<p>“It all sounds very attractive,” I said.</p>

<p>Ivanovitch stared at me for a moment. “Well,” he
remarked, after the pause, “I will arrange to have you
shown to your room to dress for the banquet. After that,
perhaps we shall see each other and I can help you choose
further. But if not, you only have to make your wishes
known to your companion. When you are dressed, the
attendant will conduct you to the banquet hall. Look
around you and choose your partner for dinner without
hesitation. Whoever you select, you will find her an
agreeable companion.”</p>

<p>The cold-blooded wickedness and cruelty underlying
the man’s whole attitude made my gorge rise, and it
was all I could do to keep from taking him by the throat
and squeezing the life out of him. But there was too
much at stake for any such move as yet, and I simply
nodded. “How delightful!”</p>

<p>Ivanovitch turned away with a little smile and pressed
a button on the wall. A door opened at once and a young
Chinese boy entered and bowed. “This gentleman will go
to the banquet,” said Ivanovitch. “Take him to his
apartment and assist him to dress.”</p>

<p>Then he turned to me. “Well, farewell for the present,
Mr. Clayton,” he said. “Enjoy yourself. But then, I
am sure you are doing that already!” And with this
parting shot he waved his hand, opened another door and
disappeared.</p>

<p>I turned and stared at the young Chinaman. “You
please to stlep this way, sar?” he inquired at once,
moving toward the door through which he had come.</p>

<p>Now mostly all Chinamen look alike to me. But this
boy’s face seemed vaguely familiar. I looked him over
closely, and suddenly I recalled the evening after my
visit to the Chief and a little dinner in a Chinese
restaurant on 39th Street with Moore. Either this was the
boy who had served us that night, or Chinamen were
more alike even than I had supposed. Had they been
watching us, then, from the very first?</p>

<p>For a moment a sense of complete helplessness swept
over me. What was the use of fighting against such an
organization? Then I shook it off savagely and nodded
to the Chinese boy to proceed.</p>

<p>He led me through a short corridor, decorated in the
same blue and gold. We came out into a huge hall,
vaulted, beautifully carpeted and lined with life-sized
and beautiful, if somewhat daring, paintings. There
were handsome lounges and chairs also, and a big oak
refectory table in the middle. The vaulted ceiling was
a mass of delicately carved and intricate woodwork.
The effect was bizarre and sensuous to a degree.</p>

<p>Between the paintings on the walls there were many
doors. My guide made for one of these and threw it
open with a bow. “Your room, sar. Please to enter.”</p>

<p>I stood still for a moment, conscious of a rustle and
murmur of voices all around me, although the hall itself
was deserted. Then I preceded the Chinese boy into a
small bedroom, delicately and quite tastefully furnished.
But here, too, gorgeous hangings which covered the walls
and a huge divan with a multitude of rich cushions
created an atmosphere both sensuous and languorous. The
effect was as clever as it was difficult to define.</p>

<p>Laid out on the bed was a sort of costume, but before
I could look at it, the boy opened another door leading
out of my room into a tiled room with a sunken bath.
“When you have bathed, sar, I will help you to dless,”
he said woodenly.</p>

<p>With a short laugh I passed him and entered the
bathroom, and he shut the door after me. Evidently no
mental effort or personal initiative was required here. I
could have imagined how this must have appealed to a
certain type of super-rich young man. I was only
surprised that the young Chinese boy had not offered to
give me my bath.</p>

<p>When I returned to the other room he was still
waiting. I had put on my clothes again, a fact which did not
seem to please him.</p>

<p>“Excuse me, sar, you not need that clothes. The
entire costume is here, sar.”</p>

<p>I was faced with a dilemma. If I took off all my
clothes, they might cart them off somewhere. And I
would have a fine chance of escaping from the place
dressed as a Roman Senator. The first cop who saw
me would run me in. On the other hand, if I refused to
wear the costume, I would give the impression that I was
not entering into the spirit of the thing—was not a very
serious reveler.</p>

<p>But the first risk was the greater, I decided. “Look
here,” I said, “have I got to wear that thing? Because
if so, I’ll stay away from the banquet. I dare say I
can get a sandwich somewhere else, eh?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, sar. You can wear that clothes if you desire.
It is more customary to wear the costume, sar, it is all!”</p>

<p>“Well, then, I’ll go as I am, I think. Lead on,
Macduff.”</p>

<p>With a bow he led the way into the hall again. We
passed silently down the length of it. At the end the
Chinese boy waited until I had come up with him. Then
he turned to the wall and pressed a button or something,
for the big doors facing us rolled silently open, and I
stood looking in upon a strange scene indeed.</p>

<p>The room into which I looked was a huge one, at least
fifty feet square and with a high-arched ceiling. Around
all four sides of it huge pillars rose to the roof. Their
sides were set with innumerable sconces, and in these
flared hundreds of great torches, furnishing the only light
in the room. Curiously enough, however, there was little
smoke, and what there was must have been drawn through
the ceiling in some way, for even the upper air was not
very smoky.</p>

<p>But I was more interested in the scene immediately
before me. In the flickering glare of the torches, which
left the corners of the room in dense shadow, I saw
that a huge low table ran around three sides of the room,
and that between this table and the pillars a series of
divans, covered with many cushions, were occupied by
couples, numbering perhaps twenty-five, or about fifty
people in all. But in addition there were many divans
vacant, or occupied by girls only.</p>

<p>The space between the pillars and the walls of the
room, about ten feet wide, was vacant except for an
attendant here and there, and served as a sort of
corridor to the different divans. It was dim in this corridor,
for the torches were all on the sides of the pillars toward
the center of the room, but I could see that the space
between the pillars and the walls ran all the way around
the room. And with one or two exceptions, which I did
not at first notice, the people there were dressed entirely
in the Roman costume. And a very beautiful costume
it is.</p>

<p>The scene was perfect in every detail, even to the
languorous music, serving as an undertone to conversation.
I might have been gazing upon a banquet given to
commemorate the appointment of Caligula’s pet horse as
Prime Minister. In my morning coat and gray trousers
I hesitated in the doorway, convinced, for a moment, that
my appearance would bring down upon me the
displeasure of Rome. Then the boy touched my arm.</p>

<p>“Please to follow the corridor, sar, and select the young
lady with whom you will dine. It is velly simple, sar.”
Then he turned away and the big doors closed behind me.</p>

<p>I was in for it and I walked, somewhat timidly, along
the corridor to my right, glancing this way and that.
Whenever I came to a girl alone, her eyes met mine
frankly. But deep in the eyes of nearly all of them lay
repulsion and fear rather than a welcome. All of them,
without exception, were beautiful.</p>

<p>Fury at this abominable captivity, if such it was,
surged up in me then. I stamped along, hardly
knowing what I was doing, longing for the power to bring
the organizers of such a place to book and set the
pathetic captives free. And suddenly my eyes met those
of a girl whose expression attracted my attention. Her
face conveyed the impression of great personal dignity,
but beneath this there struggled a desperate appeal, tragic
in its intensity. She was reclining on one of the lounges,
and she was alone.</p>

<p>I passed between two of the pillars and addressed her
quietly. “May I dine here with you?”</p>

<p>She made room for me at once. “It will give me great
pleasure,” she answered, with an obvious effort.</p>

<p>Instantly an attendant, dressed in a short toga,
appeared beside us and began to heap the table with dishes
and wines. Until he was gone I contented myself with
glancing at the strange scene about me. And it was lucky
that I did so, for in passing, my eye happened to fall on
the pillar immediately back of my companion. And in
the side of it, at about the height of a man’s head, I saw
a tiny horizontal slit, perhaps three inches long and half
an inch high. It disappeared at once, leaving the face of
the pillar smooth, but in the instance before it
disappeared, I was certain that I had caught the glint of human
eyes fixed on me.</p>

<p>The girl leaned close to me suddenly, and in terror lest
she should appeal for my help and get herself into trouble
through the watcher, I began to compliment her upon her
beauty, adding some drivel about its effect upon my own
heart, which I thought the watcher might consider
suitable for the occasion and the part I was supposed to be
playing. The watcher was too close and the music too
distant and too soft to attempt to warn her, then or later.</p>

<p>The glance, at once hopeless and disdainful, which
the girl gave me was a bitter thing to swallow, but I
swallowed it for the good of us both and the others.
Besides, the attendant was forever hovering near us, and I
did not dare hazard even a glance out of keeping with
my part.</p>

<p>The rest of that banquet is not a pleasant memory,
and I will not describe it in detail. After that first
glance my companion responded with a kind of desperate
gayety to my clumsy attempts to flirt with her. But
a good deal of the time we watched the animated scene
before us, eating and drinking automatically.</p>

<p>The center of the floor was clear, and in this space
between the tables daring but beautiful dance followed
dance in a whirl of shimmering and sensuous color and
movement. With one exception I knew no one of the
men there and none of the girls. The exception, I saw
with a start, was a very well known Senator. But I did
not know him personally and my presence meant nothing
to him.</p>

<p>In spite of myself, the barbarous languor and
sensuousness of the scene began to set strange visions running
through my brain before long, and I sat up and turned to
look at my companion. But there was nothing but
despair in her eyes. I knew that, on such a quest,
nothing but a drug of some kind could so turn my thoughts.
But evidently I alone had been drugged, in spite of the
fact that I had tasted the food carefully and drunk very
sparingly of the wine. After that I neither ate nor drank
anything at all, in spite of the persistent urging of both
my companion and the attendant who served us.</p>

<p>As time passed, one or two of the men around me
became over-attentive to their companions. But evidently
anything of that kind was barred here at least, for they
were instantly and firmly, though courteously dissuaded
by the attendants waiting on them.</p>

<p>Presently one or two men rose from their places and
staggered, assisted by their companions, toward the
big doors. Evidently they had had more to drink than
was good for them. They were all men of an educated
and cultivated type, and I could hardly believe that
human nature could sink so low among my own kind.
But hopes and plans were racing through my brain, too.
And the sight of these men gave me an idea.</p>

<p>As gradually as I could, I began to feign
drunkenness, laughing a little foolishly back into the disdainful
and desperate eyes of my companion. And presently I
staggered to my feet.</p>

<p>“C’mon,” I said; “let’s get out of this.”</p>

<p>She rose at once and took my arm, and, leaning on her
a little I made a devious course through the big doors,
opened for us by an attendant, back into the hall again.</p>

<p>“Where is your room?” asked the girl.</p>

<p>Before I could answer, the Chinese boy appeared at
my elbow and bowed. I stared at him and laughed
foolishly. “Don’ bob about so, my boy. He shouldn’t,
should he?” I appealed to my companion.</p>

<p>“This way, sar,” said the boy. He preceded us and
flung open a door, and a moment later we were back
in the room originally assigned to me. Then he went out
and closed the door.</p>

<p>The girl guided me to the divan at once, and I sank
back on it, still laughing. “Tha’s a goo’ girl,” I said.
“Pu’ some pillows unner my head, will you, dear?”</p>

<p>With a flame of disgust in her eyes the girl stooped
and, gathering some cushions, began to arrange them
under my head. As her face came close to mine I
whispered very softly, “Don’t jump. Are we watched?”</p>

<p>For an instant she grew rigid and her eyes met mine
with a wild hope and appeal in their depths. Then she
went on arranging the pillows under me. “Yes,” she
whispered, so softly that I only just caught the word.</p>

<p>“Tha’s right, my dear,” I said, and smiled at her
fatuously, “I’m goin’ sleep. Wanna stick aroun’?”</p>

<p>“Shall I sing to you?” she inquired.</p>

<p>“Sure, tha’ll be fine. Go ahead,” and I arranged
myself more comfortably and partly closed my eyes.</p>

<p>Under my lids I watched the girl go to a shelf and take
down a guitar, selecting it from among a number of
other musical instruments there. She came back and,
sitting on the divan beside me, began to sing softly. I
closed my eyes altogether then, luxuriating in the beauty
of the song she sang. For her voice was lovely. But
presently I began to breathe more deeply in the hope
that she would take the hint and go.</p>

<p>And after a time there was a soft movement beside
me, and under half-closed lids I saw her rise, replace
the guitar, turn down the light to a glow and steal silently
out of the room. I lay perfectly still and waited.</p>

<p>For what seemed to be an interminable time I lay
quietly, not daring to open my eyes fully. It was probably
only about an hour, although it seemed more like a week.
But I soon had cause to rejoice that I had waited so long,
for, although I had heard no sound, a sudden light on my
eyelids told me that some one had turned up the light
in my room again. I was lying with my back to the room
now, and so I ventured to open my eyes a little. Of
course I could not see who stood in the room at my back
directly. But fortunately the hangings on the wall in
front of me were of that Indian type of material which is
inset with tiny bits of looking-glass. And presently, in
one of these I caught a momentary glimpse of the
miniature face of my new companion. It was Mrs. Fawcette!
And she was approaching the couch on which I lay!</p>

<p>But she never reached it for suddenly the light in the
room faded out altogether, there was a stifled scream and
the sound of a scuffle, carried on wordlessly.</p>

<p>It was too much for my self-control. I turned over
on the couch. My door was open and I saw a group
of silent struggling figures framed in it for an instant
against the light, now dim, in the big hall beyond. Then
the door closed.</p>

<p>I jumped to my feet, groped my way to the door
and flung it open, rushing out into the hall beyond. It
was entirely deserted.</p>

<p>After a moment of hesitation I turned and staggered
back to my room again, muttering drunkenly. I did
not dare to start on a search yet, in any case, and what
chance had I of finding my abrupt visitors in such a
maze?</p>

<p>The door of my room had closed behind me. When
I opened it, I found my light burning dimly as before. I
went back to the divan, lay down on it and, still
grumbling to myself, pretended to go to sleep again. At least
they had treated me only as a guest as yet. So there was
still a chance that I might escape. But before that I
was determined to find out more about the place, the
conditions under which it was run and, above all, the
people running it.</p>

<p>So I lay quietly and waited, and presently I began
to snore softly. And after a long time the light in
my room slowly faded and went out altogether, leaving
me in total darkness. This much at least was a good sign,
I thought.</p>

</div>

<hr class="x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter" id="ch19">

<h2>Chapter XIX. <br> Fast in the Web</h2>

<p>My watch had a luminous dial, and after waiting
half an hour or so, snoring softly now and then,
I ventured to look at it. It was only
ten-thirty!</p>

<p>That wait was the most trying time I have ever spent.
I lay in the darkness, only daring to shift my position a
very little now and then, for the better part of three hours,
before I dared even consider making a move. Probably
all the men at the banquet were snoring by this time.
But what about the others, at the other entertainments?
And did the people who ran the place ever go to bed?
The evidence of efficiency they had shown did not lead
me to think so.</p>

<p>During that wait I did not dare let myself think of
the words of Ivanovitch about the gardens. Neither my
sister nor Natalie was present at the banquet. I was
certain of that, for I had looked at every girl in the room
very carefully, as opportunity offered. Nor was either
of them among the dancers. That left the entertainment,
the gambling-rooms and the gardens. And of the last I
dared not think.</p>

<p>But I had plenty to think about. Up to the time of
my parting from Ivanovitch in the little anteroom I
was convinced that he, and therefore the rest of the gang,
knew all about me. And the appearance of Mrs.
Fawcette in my room bore out this view. But if this was the
case, why had they allowed me to go unmolested so long?
And why had Mrs. Fawcette been seized and carried away
as soon as she got to me?</p>

<p>They were questions which seemed impossible to
answer, but I kept on trying, for I was convinced that
an answer to either of them would go a long way toward
determining my next move.</p>

<p>Had I a friend in the place? Was that the
explanation? Were they merely playing with me? Had Mrs.
Fawcette got into trouble with them and come to me for
help? Or was it possible that they really did not suspect
me, and that the words of Ivanovitch were only in the
nature of coincidences? Mrs. Fawcette might have been
looking for some one else altogether when she came into
my room.</p>

<p>At all events I could not now depend upon Pride
having traced me, although there was still a hope that
the motor policeman had not been caught in the crash
and had been able to follow on to our destination. If
anything was to be done immediately to locate where
I was, so that we could trace the place and break it up,
I had to do it and do it to-night. And the only way to
do that, that I could see, was to escape from the house
somehow, make my way back to town and retrace my
steps with reënforcements.</p>

<p>But in spite of the need for action, the fatigue of long
days of intense excitement broken by very little sleep
got at me, lying motionless there in the darkness, and for
a time I dozed off. It may be that the drug which I had
most certainly been given, although in very small
quantities, had something to do with it.</p>

<p>It was only a doze, however, and some inward monitor
must have been on guard, for at one-thirty, the time I
had planned to begin my search, I woke up with a start
and looked at my watch.</p>

<p>I was still in complete darkness. And the room and
the house too seemed silent with the silence of the dead. I
could hear no sound at all. Nevertheless the silence
seemed to have an eerie quality. It seemed not the silence
of rest and forgetfulness, but the silence of motionless
watchfulness. Such tricks will the imagination play at
such a time.</p>

<p>I, too, lay quiet and listened for what seemed a long
time. But it was only a quarter to two when I finally
rose, as noiselessly as I could, from the bed and tip-toed
to my door.</p>

<p>I listened again for a moment before I tried the handle,
and in that moment I took, with a good deal of quiet
satisfaction, another precaution.</p>

<p>I released the little safety catch on the ring which
Pride had given me and which I still wore.</p>

<p>I knew that I was in very great danger in that house;
that the people about me had no scruples about murder.
For this night at least it would be dog eat dog, then,
and I too would kill if necessary.</p>

<p>My door was not locked. I opened it very, very slowly
without a sound and stepped silently out into the big
hall. The lights here had been lowered, only a globe here
and there creating a sort of dim twilight in the place. It
was quite deserted.</p>

<p>Down the length of the hall I crept, keeping close to
the wall and treading as softly as I could. It was so
quiet that I could hear the quickened thumping of my
own heart.</p>

<p>My one hope was to reach the gardens, because they
meant the outside world and escape, perhaps. I knew
that there was practically no hope of getting out by the
way I had entered, for I had no revolver with which to
hold up the operators of the elevators and would almost
certainly be discovered anyway. But in the back of
my mind there was also the hope of being able to see
Natalie or Margaret or both, if only for a moment, and
hearten them with the news that release was on the way,
or at least that we had found them.</p>

<p>The big doors into the banquet hall were closed and
I did not dare attempt to open them, for fear of the
noise they might make. On the other hand, it was to be
supposed that most of the small doors opening off the
hall were bedrooms like my own, and there was nothing to
be gained by entering them, occupied as they probably
were by the patrons of the place in drugged slumber.</p>

<p>The only other door I knew about was the door into
the passage which led to the blue and gold anteroom
and the elevator, two doors from my own bedroom, and
that was no use to me.</p>

<p>Finally, I decided to circle the hall once at least, in
search of a larger door, before I tried the smaller ones.
For there must be some other way out of the hall, I
thought.</p>

<p>It was a weird sensation, creeping along in the half
light, avoiding the furniture and scanning the walls, while
twenty or thirty life-sized and very life-like unclad nymphs
and dryads gazed down upon me from the walls. In the
dimness they seemed to sway a little and to follow me
with their eyes, and I did not want to be seen by any one
just then.</p>

<p>I found two doors, wider than the others, at last. One
of them was locked. But to my delight the other gave
under my hand. I opened it very softly and looked
through—into total darkness.</p>

<p>At first I could hear no sound. And the place gave the
impression of some size. I mean, I was not conscious
of that sense of resistance that one meets in opening the
door of a cupboard or clothes closet in the dark. But
it might be steps either up or down. I would have given
a good deal for Larry’s electric torch at that moment.</p>

<p>I put forward a tentative foot and found solid, level,
carpeted floor. I stepped forward into the darkness and
closed the door behind me. And at that moment I heard
the first sound of another living being since I had started
on my search. The sound was a very faint sob, some
way off, but distinguishable in the utter silence about
me.</p>

<p>For a moment I stood still in complete darkness
and listened. Then I put out my hands cautiously and
encountered walls on either side, showing me that I was
in a passage of some kind. And so, with my fingers
following the walls, I advanced, stepping very slowly and
feeling out each step before I took it, lest I stumble
or fall on a stairway either up or down.</p>

<p>And as I advanced, the sound of sobbing grew louder,
although it was still hushed and faint, as though coming
to me through some solid medium. The sound came from
straight in front of me.</p>

<p>Every now and then, as I progressed, I waved one
hand in front of me slowly as a precaution against
running into something. And it was lucky that I did
so, for presently my questing fingers came up against
something solid, and I came to a halt. Investigation
showed me that it was a door. There were still walls on
either side of me. I was in a <i>cul-de-sac</i>.</p>

<p>I tried the handle very softly. The door was locked.</p>

<p>And as I stood there, wondering what to do next,
another stifled sob came to my ears. Some one was
crying beyond the locked door in front of me. I could
hear it clearly now, and with it the sound of some one
turning restlessly on a couch or a bed.</p>

<p>I listened for several minutes, hoping that the person
beyond the door would give some clue to her identity.
For it was obviously a woman. And as I listened I
was filled with pity for the heart-broken woman caught
in such a place. It seemed probable that it was Mrs.
Fawcette, after what I had seen. And a sudden impulse
came to me to find out without disclosing my own identity.
It seemed very unlikely that she would give me away,
after the way I had seen her treated. Nor would any
other woman in trouble there be likely to raise an
alarm.</p>

<p>I leaned closer to the door and called, very softly,
“Mrs. Fawcette?”</p>

<p>Instantly the sobbing ceased and there was dead silence.
Then, after a moment, I heard the rustle of clothing and
the sound of timid feet approaching the door. Again
there was silence. And then:</p>

<p>“Please, who is there?” came to me in a young girl’s
voice.</p>

<p>My heart stopped beating for an instant and then
galloped on again, and I lowered myself to my knees
and pressed my mouth to the keyhole.</p>

<p>“Margaret!” I whispered softly. “Is that you, dear?”</p>

<p>There was a little gasp behind the door and a quick
movement. “Oh, who is that? Who are you?”</p>

<p>“It’s your brother, darling!” I answered hoarsely.
“It’s Jack! For God’s sake tell me, what have they
done to you?” I fumbled at the knob. “Can you open
the door?”</p>

<p>“No, I’m locked in. Oh, Jack! Jack! You’ve found
me! I knew you would! Oh, take me away from here!
Take me home again!”</p>

<p>“I will, dear, I will! God knows I will! But not
yet. I’ve got to get help first. Tell me, what have they
done to you?”</p>

<p>There came a little sob. “Nothing, Jack, until to-night.
They’ve been pretty good to me, because they say that
if I cry it will spoil my looks. They’ve made me dance
twice and wouldn’t let me wear hardly any clothes. But
no one has been rude to me, or anything—until
to-night——”</p>

<p>“What happened to-night, dear?” I demanded
hoarsely.</p>

<p>“They—they beat me. They tied my hands to a pillar
and tied up my mouth and beat me. Oh, Jack, take me
home!”</p>

<p>Such black rage surged up in me at that, that I could
only kneel there on the floor, shaking with it. I could
not answer her for a while.</p>

<p>“Who did it—and why?” I croaked at last.</p>

<p>“Two of the men-servants tied me up—and—a
Russian named Ivanovitch beat me. I guess it wasn’t a very
hard beating, Jack, dear, but I’ve never been hit
before. And it—it sort of—hurt my pride so.”</p>

<p>“Why did they do it?” I whispered.</p>

<p>“They—they told me,” came the girlish whisper, “that
I was not to go near the banquet hall to-night, but to stay
in my room. But I thought it might be because there
was some one coming that I knew, and I took the risk
and crept out and tried to look in. But they caught me
and beat me and brought me here. And they told me
that next time they would send me to the gardens. Oh,
Jack, I can’t bear it! Can’t you open the door and take
me home?”</p>

<p>“Not yet, darling. God knows, I’d take you now
if I could. But I’m all alone here and I could not get
you out with me. I don’t know whether I can get out
myself. Tell me about the gardens. Do you know how
to get to them?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Jack, it’s awful! All the girls they have captured
here seem nice. But the ones in the gardens are not nice
at all. And they tell us that if we disobey or try to
escape, they’ll send us to the gardens. So we don’t dare
do anything.”</p>

<p>“Do you know how to get to them from here? Could
I get out that way?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know, Jack. When we’re not locked in
our rooms they guard us all the time. And I’ve only
been from my room to the dressing-room of the theater
and to the banquet hall once. They let us sit out on an
enclosed porch, too, every day. But they won’t let us
talk to each other much. Oh, Jack, when will you come
for me?”</p>

<p>“To-morrow if I can, dear. Next day at the latest.
Do just what they tell you, dear, until then, won’t you?
And keep a stiff upper lip. It won’t be long now until
we’re home again together. Have—have you seen
another girl come here lately? Her name is Natalie
Van Cleef and she comes from Utica. She’s very pretty,
with gray eyes and brown hair and lovely features. Have
you seen her?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, Jack, I think so! They brought a girl like
that here yesterday. And she is terribly frightened.
They must have maltreated her or something. I think
she is going to the banquet hall, but they locked her up
to-night. Do you know her?”</p>

<p>“Yes—I know her,” I answered hoarsely. “Do you
think you could tell her that there is help coming,
without running any risk yourself?”</p>

<p>“I’ll try, Jack. I’ll do my best. Oh, I knew you’d
come if I kept on hoping and believing. It’s been
terrible. But I shan’t be afraid any more, now I know
you’ve found me. Only, hurry, Jack, won’t you?”</p>

<p>“I’ll hurry, darling, be sure of that. But act just as
usual, won’t you, dear? Don’t give them any warning,
by your manner, that there is anything up. And don’t
let Miss Van Cleef change her manner either, if you get
a chance to talk with her. A lot depends on that, dear.
We must not warn them.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be careful, Jack. Are you going now?” There
was a little break in her voice that nearly made me break
down. But I knew that the only hope was to get away
and bring help. I could not rescue her alone, without any
idea of my whereabouts or how to get out of the place.
And I was afraid of making things still harder for her if
I tried anything like that.</p>

<p>So with a last few words to hearten her and a sobbed
little farewell in response, I turned away from the door
and retraced my steps cautiously, feeling along the walls
until I reached the lighted hall again. I was filled with
joy at the unexpected stroke of luck in finding Margaret
so soon. The nightmare of uncertainty about her was
over at last, although the task of freeing her remained.</p>

<p>There was nothing for it now but to try all the doors.
But the one nearest me was the other larger door, and in
passing I tried the handle again. The door was
unlocked!</p>

<p>I could have sworn that it was locked when I tried it
before, but it was possible that some one had passed
through it since and left it unlocked, or that I had not
turned the handle far enough before.</p>

<p>Anyway it was open now, and I crept through, testing
the floor before me with a questing foot. Here, too,
there was complete darkness. And I was in another
passage similar to the other.</p>

<p>Both the larger doors out of the hall were in a corner
of the hall farthest from the banqueting room. But they
were in different walls and consequently were at right
angles to each other. This passage, too, extended straight
ahead, so that I was going at right angles to my previous
course and farther from Margaret at every step. But
whither it was leading me I could not tell.</p>

<p>This passage differed from the other one. For as I
crept along my fingers encountered more than one door.
I tried them all and found all of them locked; so that, for
the present, I determined to follow the passage to the
end, as the easiest course, as there was no choice among
the doors.</p>

<p>And presently my eyes were rewarded with the sight
of a faint crack of light close to the floor ahead of me.
It seemed to come from beneath the door of a dimly lit
room at the end of the passage.</p>

<p>I stood still and listened. Not a sound came to me
here, however, and if the room ahead of me had an
occupant, he was either asleep or keeping very quiet; for
I could hear nothing.</p>

<p>Taking every possible precaution against noise, I crept
slowly forward, until at last my hand closed on the knob
of the door from beneath which the light came. I turned
it and it gave. And very cautiously I opened the door.</p>

<p>I was looking into an absolutely empty room. Not
a stick of furniture or carpet broke the dead white of
the walls or the brown of the polished wooden floor.
There was not even a molding on the walls. The only
thing in the room was a light bracket in the center of the
ceiling in which a single electric globe shone. But on the
other side of the room was another door.</p>

<p>Leaving the door behind me open for a means of
retreat, I stepped silently across the polished floor and
tried the handle of the door beyond. It was locked. I
made very certain of that before I gave up trying it.</p>

<p>The only thing to do, then, was to select a door, this
one or one of the doors back in the passage, and attempt
to cut out the lock by means of the little file which Pride
had given me. The door in front of me was a heavy one.
Stooping down, I saw that the light from behind me shone
on a heavy brass bolt in the crack between the door and
the jamb.</p>

<p>If I tried this door, I would have to be working in
the light too; for I had seen no switch on the walls.</p>

<p>Perhaps one of the doors in the passage would be
safer. Perhaps, too, the air under one of them might
be a little fresher than under the others, indicating a
way outdoors. I stooped down and sniffed at the
bottom of this door. But the same heavy, perfumed air
met my nostrils as pervaded the entire place.</p>

<p>I turned back again to the other door then, and
suddenly I stopped in my tracks and stood motionless. The
door through which I had come was closed.</p>

<p>It might have blown shut, of course. I stepped silently
forward and tried the handle, my heart in my mouth.
This door, too, was locked. I was trapped! They had
been watching me! I had been played with all the time!</p>

<p>I stood motionless, my heart swelling with the
bitterness of defeat when victory had seemed so near. And
as I stood there, the light above me dimmed and went
out, flashed on again, dimmed again and flashed three
times, finally remaining steady.</p>

<p>And then suddenly a voice spoke at my elbow: “Well,
Clayton, have you enjoyed your evening?”</p>

<p>I whirled around. There was no one there!</p>

<div class="chapter" id="ch20">

<h2>Chapter XX. <br> The Room of the Voices</h2>

<p>Struck dumb with amazement, I stood like a rat in
a trap, and waited patiently for some explanation
of the voice I had heard. But when it came again,
a moment later, I could not repress a start of amazement
and awe, for, though I was alone in the room, the voice
seemed to come from only a couple of feet in front of
me.</p>

<p>“I asked you whether you had enjoyed your evening?”</p>

<p>If it was ventriloquism, it was the most marvelous
example of it that I had ever heard. And I put out
my hands helplessly, with the wild thought of some
arrangements of mirrors behind which the speaker was
sheltered. But there was nothing there; nothing but
the empty room.</p>

<p>“You do not answer?” came the voice again. “Well,
it does not matter. We have done our best to make you
at home at all events. And now there is a little
reckoning to pay.”</p>

<p>Though the voice was chilled and dehumanized in a
queer way, I thought I recognized the intonation. It
was Ivanovitch again. In a moment he confirmed this.</p>

<p>“I thought we should meet again to-night, my friend,
although you have not made any effort to find me. But
it does not matter. We are forced to dispose of you,
my dear Clayton, in any case. But you are to be greatly
honored. Our Chief will speak with you himself in a
moment. I believe he intends to give you the choice of
the manner in which you will leave us. That is a great
concession, my friend. I hope you appreciate it.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know whether you can hear me or not,” I
answered in a loud voice. “But I wish to goodness you’d
appear. What on earth is all this nonsense about
anyway? I felt a little faint and came out of my room in
search of an attendant. And I’ve been looking for one
ever since. And why am I locked in?”</p>

<p>Then close to my ear I heard a laugh, the weirdest
sound in the world when there was no one there. “I
can hear you perfectly, my dear fellow, and you are as
amusing as ever. If you searched for an attendant,
surely you found one, eh? And I meant to ask you—did
you enjoy your little chat with your sister?”</p>

<p>Standing motionless in the room, I ground my teeth,
but tried to give no outward sign that the shot had gone
home. “I don’t know what you’re talking about,
Ivanovitch, but this joke has gone far enough. Let me out,
will you?”</p>

<p>I knew that it was hopeless, although I was
determined to try to the end. But hope nearly left me when
he spoke again.</p>

<p>“Come, come, Clayton, this is too bad of you! Why
do you suppose the child was beaten to-night, if not to
attract your attention and make you talk, so that we
could verify our impressions of you? And why do you
suppose the door into this passage was locked the first
time and so conveniently unlocked the second, if not to
guide you here? But enough of this nonsense. Our
Chief is here now and will speak to you. It will be better
if you listen.”</p>

<p>Again I stood and waited, and this time there came to
may ears a voice that struck chill to my heart in spite of
me. For it was as inhuman, as cold, as relentless as the
sea. Of one thing I was certain, it was the voice of a
man, but a man far removed from the usual run of mortals.
There was an immense pride in it and an immense sense
of power. But to my straining ears it did not sound the
voice of a man who was entirely sane.</p>

<p>“Clayton,” it said, “I have heard much of you of
late—too much. You have interfered with my affairs
unwarrantably and to my inconvenience. Therefore you
are to die.” There was a little pause here. “One of
my lieutenants has begged me for your life, however, and
while I will not grant that, you may choose the manner
of your death. In a moment or so you will be asleep.
When you wake one of my lieutenants will see you and
hear your wishes. That is all.”</p>

<p>The voice ceased and left me standing alone in a
bare room, fear and despair in my heart and cold sweat
on my face. For there was a power of doom, of finality,
about this voice that carried more terror and more
conviction than my waning courage could stand.</p>

<p>But it did not matter. For though I was entirely
alone and I could detect no change in the room nor in
the air I breathed, my thoughts drew inward slowly, the
walls of the room seemed to withdraw to an
immeasurable distance, and in a moment my legs gave way under
me and I sank to the floor. For a little more,
consciousness of my surroundings seemed to flicker dimly, and
then I plunged into the darkness of complete oblivion.</p>

<p>I have no exact means of telling how long it was before
I came to my senses again. I only know that one
moment I was not, and the next I was dimly aware of myself.
I was in complete darkness now, but the air of my room
was fresh with the out-of-doors.</p>

<p>I turned my head slowly. Then I sat up. My
thoughts were suddenly extraordinarily clear and I felt
no pain of any kind. Evidently the gas, or whatever it
was with which they had put me to sleep, had no bad
after-effects. At all events I felt none.</p>

<p>I was suddenly aware that I was looking through a
barred window and that the stars shone through it. And
with this sight came the realization of a queer feature
of this place into which I had ventured. For since I
had entered it, this was the first window I had seen.
With some difficulty, for I was a little weak, I struggled
to my feet and caught hold of the bars to look out. There
was no glass in the window and the night air came
through it, cool on my face. I took in deep breaths of it.
And suddenly the despair which had settled about my
heart with returning consciousness lifted a little. At all
events I was still alive and had my ring.</p>

<p>I felt for it. It was still on my finger and the safety
catch was still open. It was lucky that I had not stabbed
myself with it in falling.</p>

<p>Then I began to explore the place.</p>

<p>It was a small bare room, with one door of heavy
metal bars. There was only one window and there was no
furniture of any kind. Of course the door was locked,
but I fumbled in my pocket and found a match, lighting
it to have a look at the lock. For my little file was in my
pocket, of course.</p>

<p>Suddenly I regretted lighting the match. It might have
been seen and I wanted time, for I had determined at
once to saw through the thinner bars of the window.</p>

<p>I felt in my pocket. The little box containing the
tiny file was gone!</p>

<p>It was the cruelest blow of all, and for a moment, I
confess, I gave way to despair. Then slowly courage
returned, and I strode to the door again. The lighted
match had shown me a queer scene between the bars
of my door and I wanted to have another look at it,
if only to keep my mind occupied while I waited for
death. For at last I felt that I was to die.</p>

<p>By the flickering light of the match I saw a strange
thing indeed. The room beyond was a much larger one.
It had two windows in it, but it was entirely unfurnished
except for the extraordinary contrivance in the center
of the floor.</p>

<p>Lighting one match after another, I made out the
general aspect of this contrivance. But I was very far from
being able to explain it. Clearly it had to do with
electricity, for six thick iron pillars standing about eight feet
high were equipped with heavy wires which ran to a big
machine set against the wall and boxed in.</p>

<p>But these pillars were in a circle about ten feet in
diameter, and it was the queer affair at the center of this
circle that drew my attention most. By the light of
several matches I made out that it was some sort of cylinder,
about three feet in diameter, open at the top and bottom,
and with a hinged doorway about a foot wide. This
cylinder was about eight feet high, and both the
cylinder and the door in it seemed to be made out of some
sort of semi-opaque material that looked like Venetian
glass.</p>

<p>A network of wires ran to it from the six pillars and
seemed to be welded into the surface of it. It looked for
all the world like some sort of an electrical bath, I
thought.</p>

<p>But my last match burned my fingers before I could
make out anything further about it, and I sat down to
wait for what was to come with as much resignation as I
could muster. At all events I still had my ring. And if
I could not escape, I could perhaps take some toll from
my enemies before I died. I said my enemies, but it was
Ivanovitch that I wanted to kill. The veneer of
civilization is thin, I found, for after what he had done to
Margaret I could contemplate killing him in cold blood
quite calmly.</p>

<p>And it was Ivanovitch who came!</p>

<p>The first hint I had of the presence of any one besides
myself was the sudden glare of electric lights in the
room beyond the cell in which I stood. I went softly
to the barred door and looked through it. Two men
had just entered through a door at the other side of the
larger room. As they came from behind the glass
cylinder I saw that one of them was Ivanovitch. The other,
a lowering fellow with the face of a peasant, I had not
seen before.</p>

<p>In the bright light I took a hasty glance at my
surroundings while they came toward me. And I started
with surprise, for all of the house I had seen was built
with the very height of luxury, and here the floors and
walls were of rough stone! Was I in the same house at
all?</p>

<p>But I had time for no close inspection, for Ivanovitch
walked straight up to my door, pressed a switch at the
side of it and flooded my own cell with sudden light.
“Well, Clayton,” he began, with his cold smile, “the
best of friends must part, and you and I are no
exception, it seems. I have come to find out your wishes in the
matter.”</p>

<p>I stared back at him, my mind working like lightning.
This was my last chance, of that I felt sure, and if I were
still to win out, I must meet guile with guile. It was my
only hope, faint as it was.</p>

<p>I went slowly up to the door and took hold of the
bars. “My God, Ivanovitch,” I cried in a broken voice,
“what have I ever done to you, that you should want to
kill me?”</p>

<p>The man gave a bark of a laugh and the peasant with
him looked up and leered at my tone. “I have nothing
against you, man,” he laughed. “But the Emperor has.
You have interfered with his plans—and that is very
dangerous.”</p>

<p>“The Emperor!” I cried weakly.</p>

<p>Ivanovitch glanced over his shoulder. “Merely a
fancy of our Chief’s, Clayton. Come, how do you wish
to die?”</p>

<p>“I can’t believe you mean that, Ivanovitch. Surely
there is some way that I can get you to spare my life!”
I said: “I have money and will give it all to you. I will
join your organization, anything.”</p>

<p>He laughed again. “We are singing a different tune
now, eh?” He took from his pocket one of the air
revolvers that I had seen before and fitted it into the palm
of his hand. Then he turned to the other and spoke to
him in Russian. The fellow straightened up with another
leer, drew a heavy revolver from his pocket and pointed
it at me. Then he leaned back against the wall again,
crossing his feet.</p>

<p>Ivanovitch drew a key from another pocket and fitted
it into the lock of my door. My heart leaped with hope,
but I still turned upon him a woebegone face and shrank
back into the cell as though in terror.</p>

<p>The door swung open. “Come out,” said Ivanovitch
contemptuously. “I won’t hurt you—either now or later.
But I have orders to show this little plaything to you and
see if you prefer that way. Come out, I say!”</p>

<p>I drew away from the far wall of my cell and crept
through the doorway like a dog with his tail between his
legs. Nevertheless, the Russian retreated before me,
keeping his distance warily. When the door of my cell
had closed behind me I drooped against the wall of the
outer room and stood waiting. “What—what are you
going to do to me?” I begged. I hated myself in doing
it, but it was for the sake of the others, and I had shown
my hand too often in the past. To quiet his fear of me
was my only hope of getting near him. The other
Russian was still covering me with the heavy revolver,
and Ivanovitch left me and went to the boxed-in machine.
He pulled over a switch or something on the side of it—and
instantly the room was filled with a blinding glare of
light. But such light! It glowed now green, now
purple, now crimson, until I half closed my eyes to shut out
the brightness of it. It came from the cylinder in the
center of the room, and the latter glowed iridescent with
all the colors of the spectrum, like a living thing from
some celestial sphere. I could only look at it for a
moment, and the others too were shading their eyes. At the
same time I was conscious of an intense heat from the
cylinder.</p>

<p>I was dimly aware that Ivanovitch was speaking. The
other man handed him the cap he wore, and Ivanovitch
stepped forward and flung it into the top of the cylinder.
Then he stepped over and turned off the switch again and
the glare faded slowly and went out.</p>

<p>“You see?” he said to me, pointing to the thing.</p>

<p>I looked at the floor within the cylinder where the cap
must have fallen. There was nothing there.</p>

<p>“It is a quick and painless death,” laughed
Ivanovitch. “And it has its advantages from our standpoint
also, for it leaves no trace!”</p>

<p>I sank down on the floor against the wall. “My God,
you can’t kill me like that. You can’t kill me so soon.
Only give me a chance, man! I’ll do anything you say!”</p>

<p>Ivanovitch was losing patience. He strode over to
me. “If you do not choose the manner of your death
and choose now, into that cylinder you will go by force.
The Emperor has promised you the choice of your death,
and it is his whim to keep his promises. If you do not
choose, why——” He shrugged his shoulders. “But if
you choose now, you can die in any way you please:
drugs, shooting, this machine, drowning, suffocation, what
you will. Now choose!”</p>

<p>“I will not choose,” I cried. “Give me a little time,
only a little time——”</p>

<p>Ivanovitch ripped out an oath and stooped over me.
He caught me under the arms and lifted me to my feet,
and at the same moment I brought up my hand and
pressed the face of the ring into his wrist sharply.</p>

<p>He jumped back with a snarl and fumbled at the
pocket into which he had slipped the air revolver. Then
his hands flew to his throat, and into his face came a
terrible look of comprehension. I saw that he was
struggling to speak, and stepped forward just as the other
Russian straightened up with a glance of sudden
suspicion and raised his heavy revolver.</p>

<p>“Come and help me,” I said breathlessly, for
Ivanovitch had begun to sag at the knees. “Something has
happened to Ivanovitch!”</p>

<p>The man came forward at that in a shambling run to
look at his master, lowering the revolver as he ran. He
came to my side, still trying to see the face of Ivanovitch.
When he saw it he put out his hand to help me support
him, and with a quick movement I pressed the top of
the ring into the back of his hand too. He snatched it
away, but he was slower of comprehension; for his hands
went to his throat, and he stood swaying for a moment
before he turned to me. I dropped Ivanovitch on the
floor at that and caught at the big revolver. But there
was little need. An instant longer the fellow swayed in
my grasp, and then he, too, crumpled at the knees and
fell, his face contorting into a mask of feat and agony.</p>

<p>I turned back to Ivanovitch. The man lay where I
had dropped him, his eyes glazing, but with the light of
consciousness and comprehension still in them. As I
watched I saw this light gradually fade out of them,
and suddenly they rolled up under the lids and his
quivering body lay still. I turned back to his servant. He,
too, was still quivering, but as I looked, a last tremor
went through him and he also lay still. I was alone.
And in that moment I knew that the fates were with us
and that we should succeed.</p>

<p>But there was much to be done yet. Others might
come at any moment and I had still to escape.</p>

<p>I stooped over the body of Ivanovitch, found the air
revolver and slipped it into my pocket. Then, leaving
them where they lay, I walked to the door of the room,
switched out the lights, opened the door and went out.
I had walked out under the open sky!</p>

<p>In the faint starlight I could make out the shadowy
forms of trees and bushes all around me. A little way
off loomed the bulk of a huge house. I turned away
from it, leaving the path that connected it with the stone
house in which I had been imprisoned, and struck off
through the trees to find a way out.</p>

<p>There was light enough to see faintly where I was
walking and to make out the outlines of things close at
hand. But I was afraid of detection by some guard
who might be prowling about the place, and I stuck
closely to the shadow of the trees wherever I could. And
at last, keeping in a straight line, by looking over my
shoulder at the bulk of the house as long as I could see
it, I came to the thing I sought. It was a brick wall,
at least ten feet high and perfectly smooth.</p>

<p>Close by, however, a big tree stretched its branches
over the wall. If I could climb it I could let myself down
on to the top of the wall and so drop down on the other
side.</p>

<p>I went to the tree and looked up, and at the same
moment a hand fell on my shoulder and a voice spoke at
my ear. The words were Russian and I could not
understand them. But the man’s presence and action were
clear enough and this was no time for parley. I turned
quickly and struck him in the face with the hand on which
I wore the ring. He gave a hoarse cry and staggered
back, and I swung myself up into the tree and began to
climb.</p>

<p>By feeling my way carefully I managed to get out
on a limb that overhung the wall. My weight made it
sag until I could step off on to the wall. Here with the
limb still in my hands I looked down.</p>

<p>The ring had not yet lost its effectiveness; for in the
starlight I could make out the body of a man, prone on
the ground beneath me, his face turned up to the sky.</p>

<p>And so I released the branch, scrambled down the
outer side of the wall until I was hanging by my hands,
and let go, landing with a thud on the soft ground at the
foot of the wall.</p>

<p>I was free!</p>

<h2>Chapter XXI. <br> Beating Back</h2>

<p>Almost as soon as my feet touched the ground
I struck straight out from the wall which stretched
away on either hand, for I had a wholesome
respect for the people I had left behind me there. The
Chief—or Emperor as Ivanovitch had called him—was
doubtless waiting for the latter’s return with news of me,
and it would not be long, probably, before the deaths of
Ivanovitch and his assistant were discovered. To be
frank, there was a quality of cold and deadly chill in the
tones of the man who had spoken to me in the room of
the voices that filled me with an urgent desire to put a lot
of country between myself and him.</p>

<p>I seemed to be in some kind of an orchard now, and
the grass, while it was wet and pretty long, made decent
walking, and silent. The night was clear and dark and
I could make out the dim bulk of the trees without much
trouble, so that I made pretty good going.</p>

<p>By locating the North Star in the sky, I made out
that the wall where I left it ran west by southeast. My
own direction at right angles to it was about northeast,
so that I was going away from town. I knew nothing
about my surroundings, of course, nor what obstructions
I should find, so, for a time, I kept on in as nearly as
possible a straight line. I might be on either side of the
Island or in the middle for all I knew.</p>

<p>But it was possible that we had followed a winding
course in coming to the place, and I might not be so
far from town and from reënforcements after all. And
presently the urge came to me to strike off to the
northwest, and later bear around to the southwest again and
so encircle the place and at least find myself going in the
direction in which New York lay. For at present I was
going away from it all the time.</p>

<p>About the same time I struck a wall running at right
angles to my course and made out, in the dim light, dense
woods on the other side of it. So I turned to the right
and followed the wall, keeping close to it, so that I could
climb it and plunge into the woods at the first sign of
pursuit.</p>

<p>And presently the trees about me thinned, the land
ahead fell away and I came to the top of a bluff. I
looked down some sixty or seventy feet to a long white
beach, deserted in the starlight, and saw the white line
made by little breakers. Far in the distance shone the
lights of the Connecticut coast. I was somewhere on the
north shore of the Island; and, judging by the bluff, I
was a long way from town; somewhere out beyond Port
Jefferson, I thought.</p>

<p>Then I had a shock. My eye swept along the line of
the beach and I realized suddenly that it was not deserted.
To my left, and, as I judged, about opposite the house
from which I had escaped, I made out the dim outline of
a smack pulled part way up on the sand. I could dimly
discern the moving figures of men about it and the
murmur of voices came softly to my ears. But the boat
carried no lights nor did the men about it.</p>

<p>On impulse, I made my way along the top of the bluff
until I came almost opposite to where the boat lay.
Here my progress was stopped by a sort of gully running
inland a little way, and I lay down on the bluff to watch,
keeping my head down so that it could not show up
against the sky-line. These people might be picnickers
or almost any one. But, on the other hand, they were
close to the house I had left and I did not intend to take
any chances. They might also be bootleggers, in which
case they would hardly be pleased to see me.</p>

<p>Presently the men about the boat drew away from
it in a mass and came up the beach toward me. They
seemed to be carrying heavy burdens.</p>

<p>They came forward steadily, and I was just getting
ready to beat a retreat when I realized that they were
drawing into single file and preparing to advance into
the gully. I wriggled forward a little and looked down
again. The men moved slowly forward in single file
for a matter of twenty yards or so. Then, one by one,
they disappeared!</p>

<p>Of course I could not see very clearly. But they
certainly went into the gully and they certainly did not
come out either at the top or at the mouth! And
presently the gully was empty!</p>

<p>It was too much for my nerves, and I made a mental
note of the location of the gully in connection with the
sweep of the beach, for possible future use, and
prepared to beat a retreat. I had more pressing business
than the solution of this mystery.</p>

<p>I made my way back to my friendly wall, turned
about and headed straight inland. If I kept on in a
straight line, taking my direction roughly from the stars,
I was bound to come to a road sooner or later.</p>

<p>And so it proved. But I covered a lot of ground and
surmounted a lot of obstacles before I came to that road.
I had to strike across several farms, negotiate a brook
and beat off the interested approaches of a large black
dog before I struck a little side road, running in the
general direction I wanted. I followed this for miles as it
seemed. But at last it turned south a little and presently
ran into another larger road, running about northeast
by southwest.</p>

<p>This road, too, was deserted. So far I had encountered
not a soul, which was not difficult to understand, as it
must have been about four o’clock in the morning. But
the thought of the time made me realize suddenly the
danger of being caught anywhere near the house when
dawn came. It was late in November and would not be
light until after seven. But it would be light enough to
see long before that.</p>

<p>So, keeping close to the edge of the road and as much
as possible in the shadow, I set out to put a lot of
distance between myself and the house of orgies.</p>

<p>The night was pretty cold and I had no hat and no
overcoat. The frock-coat I wore was little protection,
and I had been thoroughly chilled both in my prison and
in my wait on the bluff. So I set myself to run to get
warm as well as to make better speed.</p>

<p>I broke into a sort of dog-trot, not difficult to keep up
for a considerable time and fairly efficient in covering
ground rapidly. And so, keeping in the shadow and
resting every now and then, I proceeded in the general
direction of New York for the better part of an hour.</p>

<p>But I felt as if the entire population of the world had
been wiped out by some catastrophe; for there was no
living thing about me anywhere. I met no one and saw no
one. There was not even a light in the few houses I
passed. And the muffled beat of my own feet on the soft
dirt road was the only sound in my ears. At last I heard
an asthmatic coughing behind me, with the unmistakable
chug of a Ford engine. I drew into the shadow of a tree
and waited. It might be pursuit. But somehow I did
not connect the thought of a Ford with my late hosts. At
any rate I determined to take a chance, and as the little
car drew closer I stepped into the middle of the road, so
that the lights shone on me, and held up my hand.</p>

<p>At first the driver tried to go around me. But I
jumped in front again and prevented that maneuver, so
that he was forced to draw up, his engine buzzing like
a swarm of angry bees in the silence.</p>

<p>“What do you want, anyhow?” came an angry,
suspicious voice.</p>

<p>“For heaven’s sake, man, give me a lift, will you?”
I answered. “My car broke down back there in the wilds
hours ago, and I’ve been tramping this road ever since
trying to find my bearings and get back to town. Can
you set me down somewhere near a railway station?”</p>

<p>The driver pressed down his pedal a little and the
car drew closer. “Is this some kind of a hold-up?” he
demanded in an angry voice. “Because if it is, you’ve
come to the wrong shop. If you can get any money out
of me I’d like to know where you find it.”</p>

<p>“It’s not a hold-up,” I laughed. “It’s a yell for help.
I don’t want to spend the entire night on your delightful
countryside.” I set the catch on my ring as I spoke.</p>

<p>My new acquaintance grunted. “Get in, and get a
move on,” he said ungraciously. “One of my patients
thinks she’s sick and I’ve got to go and tell her she ain’t.
And I want to get back and get some sleep myself.”</p>

<p>With a sigh of relief I climbed into that wheezing little
Ford. The mystery of my ungracious reception was
explained. For if any man has a right to be bad-tempered
it’s a small-town doctor.</p>

<p>As long as I live I shall bless that doctor and his car.
He took me miles on my way and, I suspect, some little
distance out his own, although he would not admit it
and was grumpy and disagreeable to the last. But he
went to the trouble of setting me down at a railroad
station, which was all that I wanted. And I bade his
grumpy back good-night with my heart in my voice.</p>

<p>For on my way I had talked to him about the place
from which I had come and had learned exactly what
I wanted to know.</p>

<p>I told him that I had broken down a long way back
and had wandered about in the woods. I pretended that
I had run against the wall about the house of orgies, and
asked him about that. I described the beach and the bluff
I had seen and asked him about that, and between the
two he was able to tell me where I must have been.</p>

<p>“You must have struck the old Rutherford place.
There’s a kind of recluse lives up there now. Bought
the place when old man Rutherford died. They say
he’s a foreigner, but nobody knows anything about him.
Lives by himself and sends a Chink lad down to the
village to get a little food now and then. But he doesn’t
keep a car, they tell me. No one ever sees him about
these parts, and they say that he never goes out of his
grounds. The Rutherford place is——” and he told me
the exact location in relation to the main road and the
small towns about.</p>

<p>“Is there a garage anywhere near his place?” I asked,
as it was a safe enough question in view of my earlier
story that I had broken down.</p>

<p>The doctor laughed. “Queer thing your asking,” he
grunted. “They do a lot of talking about that garage.”</p>

<p>“Why? What do they say?”</p>

<p>“Oh, there’s a lot more cars come there than there are
people in the neighborhood, and the folk about here
believe that there’s some sort of smuggling going on from
there. The town constable went and looked the place
over, though, and it seemed all right.”</p>

<p>I asked him where it was and he laughed again. “That’s
a funny thing too,” he said. “For it isn’t on the main
road at all. It’s on a side road. Funny place for a
garage, the people about here think, but it seems to have
plenty of business.” And he told me exactly where it
was. Here’s a health to that doctor, and may he graduate
to a large practice in the city entirely composed of wealthy
hypochondriacs.</p>

<p>When I got to the station I decided that matters were
too serious to take any further chances by going it alone.
When I had said good-bye to the doctor I found the ticket
office and woke up the night clerk. He stared at me as
if I were a ghost, but the sight of a bill changed the tenor
of his thoughts and he consented readily enough to let
me use his telephone, while he yawned and stretched
behind me.</p>

<p>And then began the most maddening half hour of my
life. I had a telephone before me and I got the first
operator almost at once, and gave her the number Captain
Peters had told me to call in case of emergency. But
that’s all the good it did me. I must have sat there for
half an hour, prodding the operator and listening in
despair for an answer from beyond.</p>

<p>It came finally, however, and it was Captain Peters
himself who answered. The fates were with me at last,
I thought.</p>

<p>“Hello, Peters. This is Clayton——” I began.</p>

<p>“Thank God!” came a bellow over the wire. “Where
are you and where is Pride? I tell you, the town has
been turned upside down looking for the two of you.”</p>

<p>“I’m out on Long Island, in the railroad station at ——.
But between you and me I wish I was somewhere else—nearer
town, for example. I don’t think the air of Long
Island agrees with me. Can you send for me? There’s
no train till morning.”</p>

<p>“Send for you! I’ll come and get you. Listen, if the
air out there is chilly, go to the police at —— on —— Street
and tell Collins, the lieutenant there, that I sent
you and that you are to be locked up there till I come.
I’ll ’phone him at once. And I’ll be there in an hour.
Will you do that?”</p>

<p>“I’ll do just that and I’ll do it now. Only get a move
on, Peters. There’s no time to lose!” I hesitated.
“Better bring some men with you, eh?”</p>

<p>“That will have to wait till morning. I can do it by
’phone anyway. I’ll see you in an hour. Good-by,”
and he rang off.</p>

<p>When I turned away from the ’phone I showed the
clerk another bill. “Look here, I’m going to start out to
walk to Jamaica, see? But some of my friends may turn
up, I don’t know, and if they do, you tell them where I’ve
gone so that they can come after and pick me up, will
you?”</p>

<p>“I sure will, mister,” he said, and pocketed the bill.</p>

<p>But my precaution was too late. As I came out of
the station a car was rounding the corner a block ahead.
I walked quickly in the direction of the police-station,
for I knew roughly where it was from Captain Peters’
directions, but after the car passed me I looked back.
It had stopped and two men were getting out of it. They
glanced in my direction, hesitated, and then hurried into
the station, while a third got out of the car and looked
after me.</p>

<p>It was getting light now and I kept glancing over my
shoulder as I walked. I quickened my pace too, for
the police-station was some little distance away. And
presently the two men ran out of the railroad station and
jumped into the car and the third man followed them.
Their car headed in the other direction. It started almost
at once, but instead of striking straight ahead it pulled
out across the road as though to turn. And I broke into
a frank run, covering the ground to that police-station
just as fast as I could put down my feet.</p>

<p>I made it too; I got there just ahead of that car, but
even then I had a narrow escape, for they drove up on
the sidewalk behind me, and I only escaped being run
over by leaping aside. It was my recent friends all right,
there could be no doubt of that.</p>

<p>Something sped past my ear a moment later and went
“spat” against the wall of the police-station. I did not
stop to argue. I burst into that station-house as if the
devil was at my heels.</p>

<p>There was a police sergeant at the desk, and he
jumped to his feet when he saw me.</p>

<p>“I’m Clayton,” I gasped. “Did Captain Peters
’phone you? They’re after me and they’re just outside.
They took a shot at me. Where’s the lieutenant?” I
jumped the barrier and went round to his side. “Where’s
Collins?”</p>

<p>Whatever criticism may be leveled at the police, they’re
good men in an emergency, all of them. “Get behind the
desk, sir. It’s all right. You’re safe now. Yes, the
captain ’phoned. Collins isn’t——”</p>

<p>He broke off, for at that moment the door burst open
and three men came in. One of them I recognized at
once as Vining. The others looked like New York men
about town. Vining gave me one quick glance. And the
concentrated determination in it made me realize that
I was as near death at that moment as I had ever
been.</p>

<p>“Get out your gun! I haven’t got one!” I whispered
to the sergeant just before Vining spoke.</p>

<p>“Good! That’s the man! Good-evening, Sergeant!”
He took a step or two in our direction. “I want that man
with you. I have been after this fellow for a long time
for robbing my flat. But he’s as slippery as an eel.
However, I’m glad you caught him at last. I have a
warrant for his arrest, and I’ll take him with me now if
you please.”</p>

<p>I saw the sergeant’s hand steal under the desk and
close on the butt of a heavy police revolver.</p>

<p>“That’s right, sir,” he answered. “He’s just given
himself up. I was going to lock him up when you came in.
Just got orders to do so. He’ll be here when you want
him, sir.”</p>

<p>Vining came a step closer, laughing. “But I want him
now, Sergeant: I’m not going to take any more chances
on his getting away. I want him where I can watch him
myself.”</p>

<p>The sergeant’s hand reached out and fell on the bell
on his desk, “Can’t do that, sir. I have orders to lock
him up.”</p>

<p>Vining stepped back a pace, as though in astonishment
and disappeared behind one of his companions. He
reappeared again just as a door opened to his left and a
couple of sleepy constables stumbled into the room.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Vining, “let’s have a good look at him to
make sure.” He came a step closer, his hand flashed up
and the light glinted on the metal object he held. I
ducked sideways, but not quite quick enough, for there
was a dull thud and a sickening pain shot through my
shoulder.</p>

<p>In a daze I heard the sergeant shout, and the next
minute heard the roar of his heavy revolver. I heard a
scream of pain and the noise of shouting and heavy feet
as I sank down on the floor; for my knees seemed to give
out under me suddenly. Then, with the uproar of some
sort of a fray still in my ears, blackness descended on me
for the second time that night.</p>

<p>When I came to myself again I was in a police cell.
The sergeant was bending over me. My eyes wandered
vaguely for a moment, and then I managed to make out
two other familiar faces. The first was that of the
doctor who had given me the lift earlier in the night. The
other belonged to my old friend Captain Peters.</p>

<p>I managed to summon a grin, in spite of the racking
pain in my shoulder. “Pretty busy night, Captain!” I
murmured. Then I glanced at the sergeant. “Did you
get any of them?”</p>

<p>The sergeant grinned—a wide, wholesome grin. “I
did that, sor. I got the one that shot you. He’s in the
next cell. The other two surrendered. They’re cooling
their heels beyond!”</p>

<p>Captain Peters strode forward to lean over me. “The
doc. here says you can travel all right. Feel well enough,
sir?”</p>

<p>I turned and stared at the doctor. He grinned back
at me. “Fine tale you told me to-night, young man,” he
laughed. “But I seem to have been on the right side,
anyway, in giving you a lift. I half suspected you were
fleeing from justice! Feel well enough to get up?”</p>

<p>I had been shot in the left shoulder. I put out my
right hand and caught hold of the sergeant and so
struggled to my feet. “Feeling first-rate now,” I told them.
“Haven’t had much sleep lately, which probably
explains why I went off like that.” I glanced at the
sergeant. “If you’ve got Vining in the next cell, you’d
better put a pretty good guard over him. <em>He’s</em> a slippery
customer, let me tell you!”</p>

<p>Captain Peters slipped his hand under my good arm.
“Can you come away with me now? There’s no time to
lose.”</p>

<p>I turned quickly. “Right you are, Captain. I had
forgotten for a moment. Good-night, Sergeant!
Good-night, Doctor.”</p>

<p>And so we left the station-house and went out into the
morning, I feeling a little weak and sick, but confident
at last that we had the knowledge for which we had been
searching so long, and that it was now only a matter of
hours before our work would be completed.</p>

<p>Captain Peters’ big police car burned up the miles to
New York, while I lay back in the tonneau, nursing my
bandaged shoulder as well as I could from the jolting,
leaning on the captain a little and relating to him
everything that had happened that night. He wanted me to
wait until we got to town and tell the story to the Chief
first. For he had wired him as soon as he got my
telephone message. But, with my aching shoulder and the
strain I had been through, I refused to wait. I alone
knew the whereabouts of the house where Natalie and
Margaret, and probably Moore, Larry and Pride, were
imprisoned, and my life had been threatened too often
that night for me to keep that vital information to myself
any longer than I had to.</p>

<p>So he was in possession of the whole story before he
reached the city. And by the time we did reach it I was
sound asleep. The captain inspired confidence. The
search, at last, was over. And if I was to be in at the
death, as I was determined to be, I would need all the
sleep I could get, while the Chief and Captain Peters
made the necessary preparations.</p>

<hr class="x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter" id="ch22">

<h2>Chapter XXII. <br> Through the Outposts</h2>

<p>When I awoke it was broad daylight. I lay for
a moment in the daze of intense fatigue and the
temporary befuddlement that follows very deep
sleep. I glanced about me at bare stone walls, a barred
window and a door made of heavier iron bars, and
suddenly I was conscious of a deadly chill at my heart.
Where was I?</p>

<p>Then memory returned, and the terror at my queer
surroundings was surmounted by an intense anxiety to
be up and doing. What had happened to Natalie and
Margaret, to Moore and Pride and Larry, while I had
been lying asleep? What might not be happening to
them now?</p>

<p>I sat up with a jerk that sent a fierce twinge of pain
through my shoulder and brought a gasp out of me, and
at the same moment I realized that some one was calling
my name, fumbling at the bars of my door the while.</p>

<p>“All right, Mr. Clayton! Just a moment, sir!”</p>

<p>I stared at the opening door. And I cannot express
my relief at the sight of a stout and powerful member
of New York’s finest, with a tray of food in his hands.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” I demanded. “And where’s Captain
Peters? And how did I get in here, anyhow?”</p>

<p>“The captain will be here in ten minutes, sir. He
just ’phoned to have you waked. And he said to tell you
that he hoped you’d eat something. You’re in the
Tombs, sir. We carried you in last night, for all the
world like a dead man.”</p>

<p>I sat up on the edge of my cot and stared at the tray
he held. I did not much relish the thought of being
in the hands of the police, after what Peters had said
about not being able to prevent my arrest earlier. If
some of the police were in the Emperor’s pay, the food
on the tray might finish me and my work once and for
all. Then I remembered who had brought me here and
confidence returned. Captain Peters would have been
sure of the men he left in charge of me.</p>

<p>So I took the tray and fell to on the breakfast, and
finding the policeman of a talkative turn of mind, I
encouraged him with an occasional affirmative or a nod if
my mouth was full, for I was in a hurry. The food
was all cut up, which was a good thing, as my left arm
was bound tight against my side. But I could make shift
with the right hand all right.</p>

<p>“The captain should be here directly, sir. He had a
gray-haired gentleman with him when he came before.
Would that be any one from Washington, maybe?
Would there be something doing?” He broke off and
stared at me inquiringly.</p>

<p>“How do I know?” I laughed.</p>

<p>The policeman scratched his head. “Well, sir, he
said to tell you to be ready in ten minutes if possible,
if you want to go with them. But he thought it would be
better to let you sleep through and not go wherever
they’re going. Would there be any chance of going with
you, sir? Did you fall, maybe, and break your arm?”
And he gazed at me blandly, but with a twinkle in his
Irish blue eyes.</p>

<p>“What else?” I inquired, and pushed the tray away
from me, for I had taken the edge from my appetite and
anxiety had returned. “But as for your going with us,
that will be for Captain Peters and maybe the
gray-haired gentleman to decide.”</p>

<p>For I guessed that the latter was the Chief—my Chief.</p>

<p>“Well, sir——” he began, and rose suddenly to his
feet, grabbed the tray and edged toward the door.</p>

<p>I looked up and the next moment was shaking hands
with the Chief, while Captain Peters grinned in the
background. The Chief’s big frame and bigger personality
seemed to fill the little cell, although neither the captain
nor I are small men. I was glad to see him, I can tell
you. And my anxiety died a little. Capable men had
the thing in hand now.</p>

<p>“Well done, Clayton!” the Chief was kind enough
to say as he shook my good hand. “Peters was all for
letting you sleep, after what you have been through. But
I knew that you would want to be in at the death. And
that won’t be long now, after what you have found out.
The captain here has told me all about it.”</p>

<p>“I would have called the captain out if he had let
me sleep!” I answered, and the Chief laughed while the
captain looked puzzled.</p>

<p>“We put you in here for safe keeping,” my Chief went
on. “I don’t know of any safer place. But I’d like to
hear the whole story from you again if you can tell it in
five minutes. Our plans are made now, and we are
merely waiting for a couple of police cars before we
start. How’s the shoulder?”</p>

<p>“First-rate, sir. Here goes then,” and I started at
the beginning when Pride and I drove up to the house of
Ivanovitch the preceding afternoon and told him
everything that had happened to me since. When I had
finished the story he nodded. “Peters had it as straight as
a die. But it’s as well to have the details confirmed in a
case of this magnitude. Eh, Peters?”</p>

<p>The captain laughed. “It is that, sir. But I listened
pretty carefully. I’ve come across some queer tales in
my time. But Mr. Clayton here has them all beat.” He
turned to me. “You had better join the police, Mr.
Clayton, for a quiet life. <em>I</em> never ran across anything
like it.”</p>

<p>“Would you tell me the plans you have made, sir?” I
asked. “I know these customers pretty well now.”</p>

<p>“Certainly.” He drew a little closer and lowered his
voice. “From your description of the place, they must
have a pretty big staff of men there, so I am not taking
any chances. I have a force of fifty plain-clothes men,
some of them police patrolmen and some Secret Service
operatives. I have called in all the men I could lay my
hands on at such short notice. That is, the men that I
could rely on with certainty. And Captain Peters here
vouches for the policemen.</p>

<p>“It’s about four o’clock in the afternoon now. The
fifty men are taking the 4.30 train from the
Pennsylvania in plain clothes, and will get off at the ———
station, after changing at Jamaica. They will wait there
till we arrive. You and Peters and I and possibly another
operative will go down by car, meet the men outside the
——— station and lead them to the place. What do
you think of the plan?”</p>

<p>I thought for a moment. “Are we going in one car
or two, sir?”</p>

<p>“Why, I don’t know. Two, I think, because it will be
easier to conceal ourselves. You see we cannot take you
by train for fear you might be recognized. We don’t
want to warn them and give them a chance to skip out.
You were killed last night in ——— police station, by
the way. Did you know that? It’s in the afternoon
papers.”</p>

<p>I grinned. “That was a mighty good idea, sir. Unless
they followed Captain Peters’ car. I have a good deal
of respect for them.”</p>

<p>“There was nobody about when you left the station-house.
And you were carried in here and might as well
have been a corpse.”</p>

<p>“That’s right. But I would suggest two cars, sir.
They blew up Pride and wrecked him, you see, and they
may try that again. And there won’t be many of us to
fight them off if they stop us. But if the other
operative and I go ahead in the first car, we can spring the
trap, if there is one. Then, if you keep a safe distance,
you can get by all right. Of course I don’t know where
they blew Pride up last time. But I don’t see how it
could have been on a main road.”</p>

<p>“No, we’ll stick to the main roads anyway. But your
idea is a good one. I think if Peters is willing, he and
the other operative had better go in the first car and
you and I in the second. Then if we get through you
know the way and I can, perhaps, plan the attack. But
I don’t think we will be molested. I have commandeered
two cars, both of them limousines. And I don’t think
that they will suspect either car, especially if no one
except the driver is visible. I will drive mine and you
can lie down out of sight in the back. Peters can drive
the other and the operative can lie down in the back.
How’s that?”</p>

<p>“All right, sir. But keep well behind the other car.
I mean keep a safe distance, so that they can’t catch us
both in the same trap. They’re a wonderfully organized
gang,” I laughed. “I don’t believe I’m timid about it,
but I want to get our friends out of the clutches of that
gang.”</p>

<p>There was a rap on the iron plate guarding the lock
on my door. There was a policeman standing there.</p>

<p>“The cars are here, sir,” he said.</p>

<p>“Come on,” said the Chief, “there’s no time to waste.”
And together we filed out of my second police cell.</p>

<p>We passed through dreary corridors, where policemen
on duty stared at us curiously, when Captain Peters was
not looking, and so out into the open street. Two big
limousines were pulled up before the door.</p>

<p>A man was lounging near one of them, keeping a
sharp look-out up and down the street. He straightened
up when he saw us and opened the door of the first car.
With a nod Peters stepped into it and the lounger
mounted after him. The car pulled away from the door
and started slowly up the street and away.</p>

<p>The Chief opened the door of the other car and
motioned me into it. He followed me and closed the door,
nodding to the liveried driver. “We’re riding together
for the present. Both drivers are men of our own. We
will rendezvous just outside Jamaica. But we’re going
there by different routes.”</p>

<p>I was filled with exultation at the thought that we
were starting on our final journey to clean up the work
that had occupied my every thought for the better part
of a year. But I was far from feeling that the task
before us was a simple one.</p>

<p>“Have you made any definite plan of campaign for
when we get there?” I asked the Chief presently.</p>

<p>He nodded. “Yes, I have, Clayton. This is a tricky
business and I know it. I have no great confidence that
a gang as well organized as the one we have to deal with
is ignorant of our movements or yours for that matter.
They have too many spies about.</p>

<p>“On the other hand,” he went on, “I am pretty certain
that they know nothing about the men who are to meet
us at the station. That was all arranged in code over
the telephone. So, while there is a chance that they will
try to hold us up before we get there, I do not believe
that they will do so, because they will think we are weak
in numbers and they can finish us better on their own
grounds. I’m banking on that to get through.</p>

<p>“When we do get there, I think the garage is our best
means of approach. If we can get into the garage and
overpower the guard, we ought to be able to take them
by surprise. And we’ll have plenty of men. Frankly,
Clayton, after what you and Peters have told me of this
gang’s resources, I’m afraid that if we surround the
place and try to take it by frontal attack, they’ll try to
cover up their traces and get away. We have no idea
how many other ‘earths’ they may have; I mean,
underground exits.” He paused. “And we want to round up
the whole gang.”</p>

<p>“That seems like a good plan,” I answered. “Those
men I saw on the beach may have been getting in by
some other entrance.”</p>

<p>“Exactly. I think we’ll try the garage, anyway,” he
concluded.</p>

<p>We left it at that and fell to speculating about Moore
and Pride, and whether they were still alive. I was
equally worried about Larry. But they had less
quarrel with him, perhaps.</p>

<p>We reached the rendezvous in good time. But the
other car, which had started ahead of us on a shorter
route, was not there. The Chief looked a little anxious,
I thought. But we waited practically in silence for an
hour or so before he voiced his anxiety.</p>

<p>“Well, Clayton, no traffic jam could have held them
up this long. Unless the car has broken down, which
isn’t likely, they’ve been picked off in some way. I think
we had better go on alone, eh?”</p>

<p>“Right you are, sir,” I answered; “I think so, too.”</p>

<p>My big, grizzled companion leaned forward and
opened the window. “Heldt,” he said, “I was going to
drop you here, but I’ll take you along if you want to
come, as the other car hasn’t turned up. What about
it?”</p>

<p>“Sure, sir,” the driver answered. “Why wouldn’t I
come along?”</p>

<p>The Chief laughed. “All right. I’m going to sit in
front with you and tell you the road, and Clayton here
will stay out of sight in the back.”</p>

<p>He got out and stepped up on the front seat with the
driver, and I settled down on the back seat, curling up
on it so that I would not be visible from outside the car.
And so we started.</p>

<p>For the better part of an hour we drove along
smoothly and with some speed. For the most part I kept
out of sight, but now and then, when my position
became too cramped to be borne any longer, I sat up and
turned over, snatching a passing glimpse out of the
windows to see where we were.</p>

<p>My shoulder pained me a good deal in the cramped
position in which I was forced to lie. But it was in a
good cause, I thought, and I was quite willing to put up
with a little discomfort.</p>

<p>In a way, however, I think that sore shoulder saved
all our lives. We had swung into a long level stretch of
road with trees growing thick and close to it on either
side, when I decided to turn again. I knew that we had
taken the toll road through the center of the Island and
that we were still on it, but in settling down on the seat
again I glanced out of the back window of the limousine,
and as I did so a man stepped out from the trees into
the road behind us and waved his hands above his head
in the direction in which we were going.</p>

<p>I jumped up and snatched open the window in front.
“Step on it! Speed up, man, for God’s sake! Hit her
up. They’ve seen us and signaled.”</p>

<p>Automatically the driver threw open his cut-out and
the big car jumped ahead, leaping under us like a
spurred horse. An instant passed and then there came
a flash and a roar from just behind us, and the glass of
the back window tinkled down on to the seat where I
lay. I jumped up and looked back. A great hole like a
shell crater spanned the road behind us.</p>

<p>Suddenly I saw three little stars appear like magic in
the glass of the side windows. “Keep low!” I shouted
and ducked down in the seat. Bullets were splintering
the woodwork and whipping through the windows all
about me. I could not see the Chief from where I lay
and I imagined that he had ducked too. But I could
see the driver and see the blood oozing from his neck.
There must have been twenty men pumping lead at us,
and the experience took me back to France with an
unpleasant distinctness.</p>

<p>But for all his wound and the whipping bullets, the
driver kept the car steady; we fled down that road like
a wounded buck, and after a moment or two we were
clear of them. I saw the Chief lean back in his seat and
reach over to take the wheel. He had been waiting with
his arms outstretched to grab it if they got the driver,
Heldt.</p>

<p>The car slowed down a little. “I’m all right, sir,” I
heard the driver announce. “Just scratched me, that’s
all. Straight ahead, sir?”</p>

<p>“Straight ahead,” answered the Chief and turned.
“All right, back there, Clayton?”</p>

<p>“All right, sir. Never touched me. How about you?”</p>

<p>“Nice hospitable lot of friends you’ve got, Clayton.
No, they didn’t touch me either. But it’s about time
we got that gang. Blowing up a main road like that.
They’ve got a nerve!” Clearly the Chief’s sense of law
and order was absolutely outraged, and I chuckled to
myself in the back seat. I was not sorry to have him
get a taste of what I had been up against.</p>

<p>After that we kept a pretty sharp look-out, both
before and behind us. But they seemed to have staked
their hopes on getting us in the road back there, for we
continued our journey unmolested. Fortunately they
had not succeeded in hitting any of the tires.</p>

<p>We got to the railroad station and pulled up in front
of it without further adventure. But I confess I was
disappointed to find it almost deserted. I expected to
find a huge crowd of men waiting for us.</p>

<p>The Chief got down and hurried into the station.
Through the window I could see him in consultation with
a man who looked like a traveling salesman. Presently
he came out again. “All right, Clayton,” he called.
“We’ll leave the car here. Come along if you feel up
to it.”</p>

<p>Heldt and I got down and walked over to the Chief
and his companion. “This is Foster, Clayton. One of
my right-hand men. Meet the other,” he added to the
stranger.</p>

<p>“Glad to meet you, Clayton. Pretty fine bit of work
you’ve done. I heard all about it. Well, it’s getting
dusk. It’ll be dark in half an hour. Guess we’d better
start, eh, sir? The men are ready for us.”</p>

<p>I was a little bewildered, but I turned with the others
and started off down the road on foot, without the
faintest idea of where I was going.</p>

<p>Presently we turned off into a little side road and then
off again in among a little group of trees. And here,
sitting in rows on fallen trees or standing talking quietly
together in groups, loomed up what seemed like a
regular regiment of men. We had all the reënforcements
now that heart could desire.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="ch23">

<h2>Chapter XXIII. <br> Within the Web</h2>

<p>We waited quietly in the woods until darkness
fell. None of us spoke above a whisper, and
there was no lighting of matches or anything
else to draw attention to us. But no one passed by in
the road outside except a party of young people in a
broken-down Ford, and our nerves survived that ordeal.</p>

<p>But at last it grew too dark in the woods to see your
own hand in front of your eyes, and then the Chief gave
the signal and we stumbled out of our hiding-place as
silently as we could.</p>

<p>We turned to the right, and the men strung out behind
us in a long single file, walking close to the edge of the
road and making little noise. The road was deserted for
the most part, but when a car or a wagon passed, the
men faded into the shadows like a band of Red Indians
and no one noticed us.</p>

<p>We came to a cross-roads presently and turned to the
left into a much smaller road. Here the Chief slowed
our pace considerably. And presently he turned back
and issued some instructions in a whisper, and two of
the men turned off and plunged into the dense woods
about us. The Chief came up and touched my arm.</p>

<p>“The house is over there,” he whispered. “Foster
knows this country around here like a book. I sent
those two men to reconnoiter it. The garage is a few
hundred feet ahead of us. We’re going to spread out
now and surround it.”</p>

<p>I stood with him in the starlit road, for the night was
moonless though clear, and watched the men file past
me like so many ghosts and disappear into the darkness
ahead and on either side of us. And presently the Chief
and Foster and I were alone in the road.</p>

<p>“Come along,” he whispered, and we walked ahead.</p>

<p>As I tramped along in the darkness my heart lightened
considerably. The goal was close at hand now and I
felt pretty certain that they would not foresee an attack
on the garage. They knew that I had escaped, and
they knew that I knew the location of the house. But
running into the doctor and learning of the suspicious
garage was pure chance and they could not know about
that. So I felt pretty secure that we were not walking
into another trap. For I hated to think of our fate, even
so many of us, if they caught us down in that tunnel.</p>

<p>Presently a building loomed up ahead of us and a
little back from the road. It was a garage, with the
familiar red gasolene pump standing outside it. A single
dim light flickered through the open doors.</p>

<p>“This is no place for a garage,” whispered Foster. “I
didn’t even know that there was one here. It hasn’t
been here very long. I’m sure of that, I’ve only been
away from these parts about a year.”</p>

<p>Suddenly the Chief spoke out in his natural voice,
even raising it a little. “Well, by the Lord Henry, here’s
a garage! What do you know about that? Boys, we’re
in luck!”</p>

<p>He stepped forward quickly into the doorway and we
followed his lead, uttering exclamations of surprise.
There were two men lounging in chairs at the back of
the garage, but there were no cars in it. They sprang
up when we entered and they seemed anything but glad
to see us.</p>

<p>The Chief tramped down the length of the place
toward them with us behind him. “Hey, you fellows,” he
called, “I’ve got a broken-down car back in the main
road a ways. Can you come and take a look at it?”</p>

<p>The two men looked at each other. Then one of them,
a surly, dark individual, shook his head. “Naw, not
to-night. We’re just going off. Bring it around in the
morning.”</p>

<p>The Chief was close to them now and they backed
away from him a little, as a guilty man always will before
a stranger who is accosting him. “But say,” he answered,
“you’re not going to leave us in the lurch like
that, are you? It’s only the pump chain’s broken. Here,
wait a minute, I brought it along to show you.”</p>

<p>He dived into his pocket and brought out a very
serviceable-looking revolver. “Throw up your hands!”
he roared at them. “Don’t move!”</p>

<p>At the sight of the revolver, one of the men had
started to make a dive toward the side of the garage.
But at the Chief’s words he halted in his tracks. “Tie
em up, you fellows,” the Chief added.</p>

<p>One after the other, Foster bound and gagged the two
swearing, foul-mouthed men, while I helped him as well
as I could with my single available hand, using odds and
ends of rope we found about the garage and part of the
men’s overalls. Then we laid them down side by side,
and not too gently, on the floor against the wall.</p>

<p>That done, the Chief took out a pocket torch and
walked over to the wall toward which the dark fellow
had made his move when first held up. We followed him.</p>

<p>For a long time the Chief studied it in the little glow
of his torch. Then he walked back to the men. “Where’s
the button, you?” he demanded. “If you want to get
off light, you’d better show us.”</p>

<p>The fellows on the floor merely stared at him, and
presently the Chief rejoined us and fell to studying the
wall again. “See that tiny crack there?” he asked me,
flashing his pocket torch up and down the wall slowly.
“That’s where the elevator comes up, I fancy. But I
have no idea how to open it. There must be a bell or a
button or something around here somewhere. It
probably opens from the other side.”</p>

<p>For a little longer the Chief searched. Then he went
to the door and, standing framed in it, waved his arms.
In a moment he turned back to us and in his wake filed
in his silent satellites until the garage was full of them.
It was exactly like a scene in a play.</p>

<p>“Now, you fellows, get up against this wall,” he said,
“where you’ll be out of sight from here.” He was
standing in front of the wall with the cracks in it. The men
filed over and leaned against the same wall. The Chief
turned back to the wall again, leaned down and pulled a
little wire lying on the floor. I had seen it, but had
taken it for a little bit of loose copper wire. When the
Chief pulled it, however, I saw that it ran into the wall
through a tiny hole. “Pretty clever, eh?” he inquired.
“Hope they haven’t got some regular signal that they
give.”</p>

<p>But the fates were with us now; for after a wait of
perhaps two minutes, there was a little jar from behind the
wall, and suddenly two sections of it swung out on hinges
like a double door. It was through this door that I must
have passed the night before.</p>

<p>Within, I caught a glimpse of a startled face as the
Chief jumped through and into the elevator. The
operator grabbed the lever and the elevator shot down again
with the two in it. We crowded into the doorway and
looked down. And a moment later it came up again,
revealing the operator on his back on the floor and the
Chief with one hand on his throat and the other on the
lever.</p>

<p>As the elevator stopped, the Chief jerked the man to
his feet and threw him out into the garage, where a dozen
or so of willing hands laid hold of him. The man was
clearly terrified out of his wits. And a moment later I
got my first and last sight of the Third Degree as it is
practised.</p>

<p>“Let him go,” said the Chief. He walked over close
to the man. “Who’s below?” he bellowed at him
suddenly.</p>

<p>The man shook his head and the Chief’s fist shot out
and caught him full in the face, stretching him flat on
his back. The Chief leaned over and jerked him to his
feet again, almost as soon as he touched the floor. “Who’s
below?” he bellowed again.</p>

<p>The fellow broke down at that. “No one, sir. So help
me God, there’s only me on duty to-night at this end.
Don’t hit me again, sir!”</p>

<p>There came a strangled sound from the floor behind
us, and I turned to see the two men we had tied up,
lying purple in the face and making the most horrible
faces at our new captive. The latter saw them too and
he broke down completely. First, he tried to make a
dash for the door. But we easily headed that off. Then
he fell on the floor at the Chief’s feet. “My God, sir,
don’t let none of them get at me. My heart never was in
this dirty business, sir. S’help me God, it wasn’t!”</p>

<p>“All right,” answered the Chief. “Come along with us
and show us the way, and we’ll see what can be done for
you later on.”</p>

<p>It was a fairly sickening sight. For the man’s terror
was abject, surrounded as he was by such an army of
enemies, there in the dim garage. I was glad when the first
car-load of us, including the Chief, the former operator
and myself, stepped into the more brightly lighted elevator
and started on our journey into the nether regions.</p>

<p>“This is the place all right,” I whispered to the Chief.
“It’s exactly the same smell. Hope they don’t drown us
out down there like rats in a trap. It’s a long tunnel.”</p>

<p>The Chief laughed. “I don’t think there is much
danger of that. We haven’t given any one a chance to give
the alarm yet. And if it had been given, this fellow would
be a lot less anxious to come with us,” and he indicated the
late elevator operator. “I’m banking on that.”</p>

<p>The elevator was a simple one to operate. But the
Chief let the former operator take charge of it again
as soon as we had started, only directing two of his men
to keep a tight hold on the man and another to keep him
covered. But there was little fight or trickery left in that
fellow.</p>

<p>Just before the car stopped I spoke to the Chief again.
“Are the others coming after us?”</p>

<p>“One more load,” he answered. “I’m sending Foster
up again. The others are going into the woods to
surround the house and cut off any attempt at breaking out.
That’s why I sent out two scouts to look over the land.
But I think you and I had better keep on with this, eh?”</p>

<p>“I’d hate to miss it,” I answered. A moment later the
elevator stopped.</p>

<p>We stepped out into a brightly lighted room, the top of
which was of rough wood shored up with heavy beams.
The walls were of unpainted planks. Ahead of us
stretched a long tunnel about ten feet high by eight feet
wide, lit at intervals by small electric bulbs. The floor of
it carried a narrow-gauge track. The air was dank and
cool, as I well remembered.</p>

<p>The elevator went up to the surface again under the
charge of Foster, and the Chief turned to the operator.
“Where’s the car?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“At the other end, sir,” whimpered the fellow.</p>

<p>“Is it automatic or operated by hand?”</p>

<p>“Automatic electric, sir. But if I signal for it, the
operator at the other end will have to send it. He’ll be
on the look-out for us, then. Shall I signal it, sir?”</p>

<p>“How long a ride is it?” demanded the Chief.</p>

<p>“About three hundred yards, sir.”</p>

<p>“All right, signal for it,” answered the Chief.</p>

<p>I would have hesitated about sending that signal. But
I felt that the thing was in more capable hands than my
own and I said nothing.</p>

<p>The man leaned over a table which stood beside the
little platform for passengers on which we were
standing and pulled down a buzzer on the wall behind it—a
buzzer similar to the one with which the signal for help
had been given from the house of Mrs. Fawcette.</p>

<p>After the sound of it had died away in the clammy,
silent air of the tunnel, we stood and waited expectantly.
But the second load of men arrived in the elevator before
anything was visible in the tunnel. Foster was not with
this second lot, having remained above to direct the men
who were to surround the house.</p>

<p>Again we settled down to silence and then, far off in
the tunnel, a little car became visible, gliding steadily
towards us. It drew closed and closer until we could see
that it had accommodation for about eight passengers,
in four parallel seats. But it was quite empty. Just
before it reached us there was a click and a flash of blue
light, and the little car slowed down and stopped at the
platform in front of us. It made a most eerie impression
on me.</p>

<p>“Now,” said the Chief, turning and looming over the
crowd of us as he drew himself up, “you and I, Blake,
are going to make the trip with this fellow”—he indicated
the operator—“and then you’ll come back with him and
get another car-load, and so on until we all reach the other
end. In the meantime, I’ll keep guard down there. Not
more than two or three can go this first time or we’re likely
to set up a scare when we get there.” He turned to me,
“I’d like to have you go along, Clayton, this time, but
there’ll be at least two men to watch and you’ve only got
one arm.”</p>

<p>I could not put up an argument against that, and
presently the Chief and the man we had captured,
together with Blake, one of the Secret Service men, mounted
the little car and started on their crucial journey.</p>

<p>My heart was in my mouth as the car gathered speed,
slid into the tunnel and grew steadily smaller in the
distance, finally rounding a curve and disappearing from
sight.</p>

<p>And it was a long and anxious wait, standing huddled
together in that dank, silent, underground place, straining
our ears for the sound of shots from down the tunnel,
while I at least pictured the Chief as killed or captured at
the other end and the alarm given.</p>

<p>It had taken the little car about five minutes to come
to us the first time, after the operator had signaled for it,
so I allowed twelve minutes as the maximum time it
should take for it to get back to us again, if all went well.
But the minutes dragged along and there was still nothing
in sight down the length of the tunnel.</p>

<p>At last, when fifteen minutes had passed and we were
still anxiously waiting, I turned to the men about me and
addressed them in a low voice. “Look here, you fellows,”
I said, “now that the Chief is not here, I do not know
who is in command among you. But I feel pretty sure
that something has gone wrong at the other end. Are you
willing to follow me into the tunnel on foot and try to
reach the Chief? He may be in desperate need of our
help while we are waiting here.”</p>

<p>For a moment or two they stared at each other. Then
one of them spoke up, crowding forward to my side: “I’m
with you, sir, let’s go ahead and try to reach him!” He
stared at the others and a number of them murmured
their assent.</p>

<p>“Right!” I said. “Come on, then. But be sure to
walk in the middle of the track. I think that car is run
with a battery, but it may be some sort of a third rail affair.
Are you ready?”</p>

<p>And I stepped down into the tunnel and started to walk
briskly along it.</p>

<p>I did not look back at once, for I could hear the others
behind me, but after a moment I glanced over my
shoulder. They were strung out along the track in single file.
And I set my face to the walk and the work ahead with
a confident mind and did not look back again.</p>

<p>It was a longer walk than I had expected. The car
must have been able to develop a considerable speed.
But after we had trudged along for perhaps ten minutes
or so, stooping down now and then to avoid low places
in the roof, we rounded a corner and saw another
platform like the one we had left, twenty or thirty yards ahead
of us. I broke into a run and the others came pounding
after me. And as I drew near enough to take in the
details of what lay ahead, I gave a shout and put on every
bit of speed that I could muster.</p>

<p>The other platform was similar to the one we had
left and the little car was stationary in front of it. The
operator we had captured was sprawled half in and half
out of it. Blake lay face down in the tunnel, and on the
platform beyond the Chief rolled this way and that, in
the grip of one of the biggest men I have ever seen,
The light glinted on the Chief’s revolver, still in his hand,
but his opponent had that wrist in his grip, while the Chief
had reversed the position with his other arm and held the
fellow’s other wrist. They had been struggling there for
nearly fifteen minutes when we came, and it has always
been a mystery to me how the Chief held out so long in the
grip of so powerful a man. But he did hold out and so
saved the situation and probably all our lives into the
bargain.</p>

<p>I did not wait to parley, but scrambled up on the
platform between the car and the end of the tunnel. The
Chief was on his back, with his opponent on top of him.
I stooped down, slipped the revolver out of the Chief’s
fingers and brought it down with all my force on the back
of the big man’s head. He relaxed at once and the Chief
heaved him off and struggled painfully to his feet. Then
he held out his hand. “Good man, Clayton,” he said
quietly, “I was nearly done for. I won’t forget this.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense, you saved us all by hanging on so long,” I
answered. “Now what, sir? The men are all here behind
me.”</p>

<p>The Chief shook himself and instinctively settled his
clothes on him. “He had a grip like a bear!” he
muttered. “Guess I’m getting old!” Then to me he added,
“Let’s get as many men as we can cram into the elevator
and go up and clean up with them. I’m getting mad!
Come on, men!”</p>

<p>At the back of the platform another larger elevator
stood empty and waiting. Two of the men fell on the big
fellow and tied him up securely. The first operator we
had captured was stone dead with a bullet through the
middle of his head. We left him where he lay. Blake,
too, was dead and we lifted him onto the platform. There
were about twenty of us in all, and by squeezing tightly
together we managed to crowd into this larger elevator.
Then the last man closed the door and the Chief began to
experiment with the mechanism. It was quite a simple
one, and after a moment we started smoothly upward to
our final goal. It was a moment big with tension and I
think we all felt it.</p>

<p>“Listen now, men,” said the Chief, soon after we
started. “This is a case of no parley and no quarter.
We’ve got to work fast and take them all by surprise,
for we’re dealing with men who stop at nothing.
Understand, all of you?”</p>

<p>There was a murmur of assent.</p>

<p>“And another thing,” he added. “There are a lot of
women ahead, as some of you know. You’ll have to be
mighty careful where you shoot! But otherwise, do not
hesitate to shoot.”</p>

<p>There was another murmur and then we rode on in
silence.</p>

<h2>Chapter XXIV. <br> The Web Is Torn</h2>

<p>Presently the bottom of a door appeared, and a
moment later the car stopped of its own accord.
We held our breaths, listening.</p>

<p>Then the Chief slid the iron grille of the elevator
softly out of the way and fumbled at the door beyond.
We could hear no sound from the other side of the door,
and at last the Chief pushed it quietly open and we
poured out in a body into the little blue and gold lobby.
I had been in it only the night before, but the time seemed
months ago as I glanced quickly around. It was deserted.</p>

<p>“Which way to the main hall?” whispered the Chief;
for the lobby had several doors leading out of it.</p>

<p>I walked over to the little door through which I had
passed before and softly opened it. The corridor beyond
was empty too.</p>

<p>The Chief and his men crowded in behind me. “Get
your guns ready now!” whispered the former. “Lead on,
Clayton!”</p>

<p>I quickened my pace, reached the door that led into the
main hall and softly opened it, sticking my head cautiously
around the corner. The big hall, with its vivid and
somewhat indelicate paintings, was deserted also, and the lights
were turned low, as I remembered them last. The last
man into the big hall closed the door behind him.</p>

<p>“The banquet room is there,” I whispered, pointing it
out to the Chief. “And the room of the voices is beyond
there. That’s the blind corridor I told you about,” I
added, pointing toward the far corner of the hall. “I
think the others are sleeping-rooms.”</p>

<p>The Chief stepped silently around the center table and
down the hall, with us close behind him. He laid hold
of the big doors into the banqueting hall. As he did so,
a small door opened behind us, and I turned in time to
catch sight of a startled Chinese face peering around the
door which led into the blind corridor where I had talked
with Margaret. Before I could make any sign the face
disappeared. The next instant the lights went out and
we were in complete darkness.</p>

<p>Then the Chief flung open the big doors, and we surged
forward.</p>

<p>But the Chief and his men halted on the threshold,
staring in momentary amazement at the strange scene
before them. And I too drew up and stared over their
shoulders, for I could not believe at first that this was the same
room in which I had dined only the night before. The
pillars, running around the room and forming a sort of
corridor on all four sides of it, were still there. But
instead of being apparently solid as I remembered them,
they now seemed to be formed of some semi-transparent
material, through which bright lights in their interiors
made a brilliant but diffused glow in the room.</p>

<p>Otherwise the place was entirely changed. The big
open space enclosed by the pillars, and which had formerly
held the divans, had now been converted in some way into
a shallow lake. In the middle of this lake floated a huge
and really wonderful reproduction of an Egyptian royal
barge at anchor. The water was only a couple of feet deep
and servants, waiting on the diners on the barge, were
wading back and forth between the barge and the
corridor formed by the pillars. Even the skin of these men
had been browned and they were clad in loin-cloths
only.</p>

<p>But the deck of the barge itself presented a scene of
very real though almost indescribable beauty. There
were many girls, lightly clad, reclining on the cushions
arranged about low tables on the deck. The men beside
them were also lightly clad in Egyptian costumes, many
of them, though some were in conventional evening dress.
But the barge itself was a mass of rich hangings and
cushions and tapestries and rugs, many of them trailing in the
water, while the low tables were massed with dishes and
flowers. A small orchestra, in Egyptian costume and
equipped with queer Egyptian instruments, was seated in
the bow of the barge. The latter had a huge silken
lateen sail, and from the cross-arm which upheld this sail
big pendent lamps, fashioned like flowers, cast a bright
rosy light on the deck below, making it seem like
fairyland. Queer barbaric strains from the little orchestra
floated to our ears on the perfume-laden air. Even the
water of the tank had the big green leaves and huge white
blossoms of hundreds of water-lilies floating on its glinting
surface.</p>

<p>While I was still half-enchanted by the real beauty of
the scene, the Chief stepped forward to the edge of the
tank.</p>

<p>“Hands up and stop where you are!” he shouted, and
leveled the two revolvers he held.</p>

<p>The queer music in the air died out in a sudden
discord. And at the same moment there came the whine
and thud of bullets about us and a man beside me shrieked
once and fell, writhing.</p>

<p>“Scatter!” shouted the Chief over his shoulder to us,
for we were bunched together in the doorway and offered
a beautiful target. Then, while the girls on the barge
shrieked and shrieked, cowering down among the rich
hangings, there followed a battle wildly confused and
confusing.</p>

<p>Some of our men slid along the walls of the banqueting
hall with the idea of surrounding the place. Others
dashed back into the dark main hall, their guns spitting
vicious flames, while they hugged the walls to be out
of the light from the luminous pillars. The doorway
was cleared in an instant, the Chief and I ducking
behind two of the pillars to shelter our backs while we
covered the servants.</p>

<p>But there were fifteen or so of these brown-skinned
attendants, some of them in the corridors and some in
the water. And when they realized that they had only
a few men to deal with, they suddenly broke and scattered
in all directions. The Chief and I sent shot after shot
in their wake, bringing two of them down and whipping
up the waters of the tank into tiny fountains that set the
lily pads to rocking wildly. But the rest of those in the
water clambered out into the corridor, ahead of our men
who had started to encircle them, dashed through
doorways and disappeared. The servants in the corridors had
already vanished.</p>

<p>I left the Chief and ran back into the darkness of the
main hall to see how things were going there, keeping
close to the wall as I went. Heads, dimly visible in the
reflected light from the banquet room, were popping out
of doorways and revolvers spat and cracked from all
directions, while direct and ricochet bullets whined and
screamed up and down the place incessantly. Some of
the heads took our bullets back with them, but our men
were falling too. With the uproar of the firing, the smoke
of it and the groans and cries of the wounded, it was
hard to get a clear idea in the confusion of how things
were going. But presently I saw that our men were
fighting their way slowly forward, flinging open the doors off
the hall as they came to them and rushing through. And
being far better marksmen than our enemies, they caught
and killed the Chinamen and Russians in the different
rooms like rats in a trap.</p>

<p>Through an open door I caught a glimpse of one such
duel. In the dim-lit room crouched a Chinaman, his
yellow, snarling face upturned and his hand flung back
with a knife glinting in it, then the darting flames of two
shots from a corner just within the door seemed to transfix
him. And as I watched, the yellow face stiffened into a
ghastly grin, the knife fell to the floor and the huddled
figure slowly collapsed, as one of our men stepped out
into the hall again, methodically reloading his gun. The
Chief’s forces were all picked men, and they gave a
wonderful exhibition of fearless determination and devotion
to duty that night.</p>

<p>Finding that we were getting the best of things in the
main hall, I turned back to the banqueting room. As I
reached the big doorway I saw that firing had now broken
out here too, bullets whipping up the water here and there,
and some of them whining through the doorway into the
main hall and placing us between two fires.</p>

<p>Some of the servants had returned with guns and were
popping out from behind the pillars on the far side of
the room, firing at the Chief and his men. I joined the
Chief behind the pillar and took stock of the situation
as well as I could in the confusion. I was in a frenzy of
anxiety, for our opponents were poor shots, as an
occasional scream from the barge testified—and I could not tell
whether Natalie and Margaret were among those cowering
girls exposed to the flying bullets.</p>

<p>In a moment, however, I saw that the Chief’s men were
holding their own and were gradually carrying out an
encircling movement around both sides of the room. I felt
pretty sure that our men in the hall were getting the best
of it. So I jumped forward to the edge of the tank, and in
spite of a warning shout from the Chief, I stepped down
among the wildly rocking lily pads and spouting little
geysers, where bullets whipped up the water, and started
wading toward the barge, firing as I went, whenever I saw
a leg, an arm or a head behind one of the far pillars.</p>

<p>It was an exciting walk while it lasted, for the bullets
were screaming perilously close. But our foes were the
worst kind of marksmen, and presently I reached the
barge untouched and stepped up on to a low gangway at
the side and thence to the deck.</p>

<p>Immediately in front of me lay a girl, bare of limb
and wearing the Egyptian girdle about her waist and the
cobra head-dress. Silk panels, now tumbled about her,
hung from the girdle. As I stepped on to the deck she
raised a lovely face, drawn with terror, and saw me.</p>

<p>“Oh, Jack, Jack!” she cried. “Take me away!”</p>

<p>It was Natalie!</p>

<p>I jumped forward, the revolver still in my one good
hand, and, kneeling down, caught her up to me. As I
did so the firing died down suddenly and other girls near
by raised their heads and began to stare about them in
terror. In the girl next to Natalie I recognized my
companion of the evening before. Her eyes flashed sudden
recognition and then swerved to the girl I held. And I
determined to leave Natalie in her charge until our work
was done.</p>

<p>I stooped and kissed Natalie and then, thank God,
I looked up again quickly. For immediately behind her
another woman had seen us, and I found myself staring
into the face of Mrs. Fawcette. But she was not looking
at me. She was looking at Natalie. And at the moment
I saw her, she drew a small revolver from her girdle and
slowly raised it until it pointed at the back of the
unconscious girl I held. My companion of the night before saw
it too and screamed suddenly.</p>

<p>There could be no mistaking the bitter determination
in the woman’s face. But there was no time to draw
Natalie aside and face her myself. And almost of its own
volition the gun in my hand roared out behind Natalie’s
back.</p>

<p>With a sobbing cry, Mrs. Fawcette slowly fell back
on to the deck, her face upturned now and her eyes on
mine.</p>

<p>I released Natalie and set her gently down. Then
I stepped over her and went up to Mrs. Fawcette, my
mind one blind question and my heart sick at the futile
tragedy of it.</p>

<p>She stared up at me as I stooped above her. “<em>You</em>
shot me!” she whispered wonderingly. “You!” she
moaned faintly. “And only last night I tried to save
you!”</p>

<p>I went down on my knees beside her. “Why did you
try to shoot Natalie?” I demanded desperately.</p>

<p>“Why? What else could I do?” She stared at me for
the moment. Then a very bitter smile set her face in
grim lines. “Kismet!” she murmured.</p>

<p>A moment later her body straightened into a rigid bow
and fell limp again. And I could only lean down and
close the staring eyes; for she was dead.</p>

<p>After the tribute of a silent regard of the woman I
had killed, I turned away, sick at heart over what I had
had to do, and sought Natalie. The other girl, I found,
had taken Natalie into her arms. Fortunately the latter
had been very close to unconsciousness when I set her
down and had seen nothing of what had happened.</p>

<p>“Stop here quietly,” I whispered, “I’ll come back for
you both!” and with that I jumped down into the water
again and waded over to where the Chief was already
gathering his men. For here in the banqueting room the
battle was over and we had conquered.</p>

<p>“Hurry up, Clayton,” cried the Chief. “We’re waiting
for you.”</p>

<p>The firing in the main hall had died out also, and
now the place was almost silent, except for the frightened
sobbing of some of the girls on the barge and the moaning
of our own wounded. No quarter had been asked or given
on either side, but we had been able to rescue some of our
own men and bind up their wounds.</p>

<p>Some one had found the switch and the lights in the
main hall were on full. The place was a shambles. Dead
men, in queer, contorted attitudes, their faces pale, sunken
and ghastly in the bright light, lay scattered about the
walls. The walls themselves were seamed with bright
slashes from flying bullets and the naked nymphs still
simpered down on us, though their bodies were tattered
and torn. The hardwood floor was a welter of blood in
streaks and half-congealed pools. The room was not a
pretty sight.</p>

<p>We had lost over half our number, a hasty count
showing eleven men killed or badly wounded. Most of the
others had flesh wounds, although the Chief and I had
escaped scot-free. But we had certainly accounted for a
much greater number of our enemies. At all events they
seemed to have had enough, for the present at any rate.
After we had taken stock of our losses, the Chief stepped
forward and faced the eight or nine of us left.</p>

<p>“You, Johnson, and you,” he said, “stay here and keep
an eye on those girls. Keep the men on the boat where
they are. We’ll want them later. The rest of you scatter
and clean the place up. Break down the doors and
explore the whole house. Let the others in too, as soon as
you can find the way out. They must be just outside by
now. If you hear me whistle, come back here on the run.
But if you can find the head of the gang, take him alive.
I want that man.”</p>

<p>He turned to me.</p>

<p>“Come on, Clayton. Let’s round up that Emperor
of theirs. You all right?”</p>

<p>“Not a scratch, sir.”</p>

<p>He came closer, putting his hand on my shoulder for
an instant. “You did the only thing, lad, I saw it all.
Don’t look so down in the mouth about it. Any one
would have done the same. Come on, let’s go!” and
that was the only time the Chief and I discussed the death
of Mrs. Fawcette.</p>

<p>The others had scattered in all directions, and in a
moment the place was a bedlam with the crash of blows
and the crack of splintering wood, as the men set
themselves to break open locked doors.</p>

<p>One man found a staircase leading up from a small
door in the main hall, and started up into the darkness
to explore the floor above. But the Chief and I made
for the corridor that led to the room of the voices, kicking
or jemmying open the doors we passed, and making as
sure as we could that we left no enemies behind us to take
us in the rear.</p>

<p>Evidently the place was a regular labyrinth. But
the most curious feature of it was the fact that we found
no windows anywhere. The inhabitants must have lived
eternally in an artificial light or in darkness.</p>

<p>The door opening into the room of the voices was
closed but not locked, and I flung it open. The room
was bare as I remembered it, and I strode across to the
door beyond, followed by the Chief. This second door
was locked, but the Chief set to work on it at once with
his jemmy.</p>

<p>And then suddenly the tool slipped out of his hand
and clattered on the floor, and he put out his hand to
the wall for support. At the same moment he seemed
to grow dim before my eyes, receding into a tiny
figure.</p>

<p>With a yell of “Gas!” that was little more than a croak
in my ears, I summoned every bit of strength I had left
and jumped for the Chief, catching him about the
shoulders and sending him spinning in the direction of the open
door through which we had just passed. I followed him
and we both fell to our knees in the middle of the room;
but he must have realized the danger by now, for he
managed somehow to drag himself on his hands and knees as
far as the open door and through it. I also succeeded in
rolling after him and out of the room, with one last
effort kicking the door shut behind me. Then we lay
motionless and panting until our wits and strength
gradually returned and we were able to sit up and stare at each
other.</p>

<p>“The Emperor again!” I gasped weakly.</p>

<p>“Couple of fools, we are!” grumbled the Chief in
reply. “But I won’t forget that, Clayton. That’s twice
you’ve pulled me out of a nasty mess. Wow, but that
was some gas. You can’t even smell it!”</p>

<p>I got slowly to my feet.</p>

<p>“Let’s try that staircase,” I said. “We can’t get through
this way.”</p>

<p>After a moment the Chief, too, struggled to his feet
and we made our way laboriously back down the corridor
to the main hall. Fortunately the effects of the gas wore
off very quickly, and by the time we reached the hall we
were both practically ourselves again.</p>

<p>There was no one in the main hall as we entered it.
But the doors to the banqueting room were still open and
I could see our two men still on guard in there. The Chief
and I started to cross the hall, making for the little door
that led to the staircase to the floor above, but we were
not to explore that floor just then, for while we were still
in the middle of the hall, part of the wall at the far end of
it suddenly flew open in two sections with a crash, and
the Chief and I turned to find a crowd of swarthy,
jabbering men pouring into the room.</p>

<p>“More of them!” shouted the Chief. “Come on,
Clayton.”</p>

<p>He jumped forward to the big table in the middle of
the hall, overturned it and swung it round to form a
barrier between us and our oncoming enemies, just as the
latter caught sight of us.</p>

<p>I fell on my knees beside him and drew my revolver.
The newcomers set up a yell and started for us, and
quickly the Chief put his whistle to his lips and blew it
for all he was worth, at the same time opening fire with the
revolver in his other hand.</p>

</div>

<hr class="x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter" id="ch25">

<h2>Chapter XXV. <br> The Emperor</h2>

<p>During the next few seconds we put in the hottest
bit of work of the entire evening.</p>

<p>They came very close to rushing us at the start.
I have a confused recollection of a mass of
murderous-looking ruffians bearing down on us, firing as they came,
while the table behind which we were sheltered cracked
incessantly with the smack of their bullets.</p>

<p>My own revolver was full again fortunately, and the
Chief’s seemed to be also, for we shot into the crowd
of them again and again, bringing a man down with almost
every shot.</p>

<p>But they kept on, and when they reached the table my
revolver was empty. I jumped to my feet and dashed the
butt of it between the eyes of a big Russian. His face
streamed blood at the blow and he leapt back with a
yell of pain, bearing back the men behind him. At the
same moment the Chief got his second gun into action and
fired past me as fast as he could work the trigger, his shots
seeming to follow one another in a steady stream.</p>

<p>For a moment they fell back and I crouched down
behind the table again, fumbling in my pocket for fresh
cartridges and cursing my clumsy fingers. Then there was
a yell from behind me as the two guards from the
banquet room rushed up, and four revolvers began to stream
death over our shoulders into the huddled mass of men
ahead of us. A moment later other revolvers began to
crack from the different doorways, as the Chief’s forces
came running back to the hall in response to his whistle.</p>

<p>And suddenly the men ahead of us broke and dashed,
yelling, from the open doorway into the corridor which
led to the room of the voices, leaving eight or ten of their
numbers silent and motionless, or still convulsed with
agony, on the floor in front of us.</p>

<p>Revolvers were still cracking near at hand, however,
and I looked beyond our fallen foes and realized
suddenly that I was gazing out into the night. The two
sections of the wall that had opened inward like folding
doors disclosed a short wide hallway beyond them. And
beyond that was what looked like the original wide front
door of the house. Two or three of the enemy were still
sheltering behind the edges of this doorway, and firing,
not at us but out into the night. Beyond them I could see
the dark outlines of trees. And in among these trees I
could make out the occasional spitting flash of a revolver.
Evidently our reënforcements had arrived, had met with
resistance and had driven the Emperor’s forces in upon us.</p>

<p>This time the Chief was mad clear through. “Get back
to that room, you two, and guard those girls,” he shouted.
Then he raised his revolvers, which he had managed to
reload somehow, and began calmly picking off the men in
the doorway.</p>

<p>At the same moment our fellows outside, who had
heard the Chief’s whistle, decided to rush the place. For
there came a crescendo of shots from closer at hand, and
suddenly the last of the defenders of the doorway pitched
forward on his face and the little hallway was full of our
men.</p>

<p>“Come on, you men, clean this place up!” yelled the
Chief. “Shoot them down and shoot to kill. We’ve lost
enough men over this business!” He pointed into the
corridor. “After them!” he shouted.</p>

<p>As I remarked once before, I think, the Chief was a
good man to have on one’s side, but a bad opponent.
He certainly looked dangerous enough at this moment, for
his gray hair was streaked with blood from a scalp wound,
his coat was torn and bloody in two places on the
shoulders, where bullets had grazed him above the edge of the
table, and his eyes blazed with energy and anger, while
his mouth was a mere slit in a grim and formidable jaw.</p>

<p>I stepped over to him. “The gas!” I shouted. “Don’t
let our men——”</p>

<p>Instantly he jumped for the corridor, blowing his
whistle as he went. I followed at his heels.</p>

<p>But there was little need. We met the Chief’s forces
returning, awe writ large on their faces. And down the
hall beyond them, the open door into the room of the
voices disclosed a number of our late enemies lying
huddled on the floor of that deadly room in the same
attitudes in which they had fallen as the gas overcame them.
It seemed that the first one of our men who had followed
them into the room to investigate, had been overcome
by the gas himself and had been hauled out again by a
couple of venturesome companions, holding their noses
by way of a safeguard. By the time we reached him he
had fully recovered again. For once the Emperor had
played into our hands, it seemed.</p>

<p>As soon as the Chief had assured himself that the men
in the room of the voices were not playing ’possum, he
directed six or eight of his now numerous forces to dash
into the room, haul out the enemy one by one and tie them
up. That done he turned back to me again.</p>

<p>“Come on, Clayton, we’ll tackle that staircase now—and
we’ll take a couple of others with us, while the rest
of them finish cleaning up the place.”</p>

<p>He blew his whistle then, and the men, some of whom
had scattered again, gathered around him. “Now, you
men, finish the job and capture every one else you find
alive, unless they put up a fight. We’ve broken the back
of this business and there’s no need for any more
bloodshed. Keep an eye out for prisoners too. They may have
some of our friends still locked up here. I want a couple
of you to join those fellows in the dining-room there and
take those men into custody. Tie them up if necessary.
And tell the girls that they can go and get dressed if they
want to. Burke and Tallman, I want you to follow me.
That’s all. The rest of you go to it.”</p>

<p>With that we started back across the hall again,
followed by two of the Chief’s men, and made our way to the
foot of the little staircase leading to the floor above.
Looking up that little staircase, there was nothing but a
velvety blackness to be seen, and I confess that the effect
was not inviting.</p>

<p>However, we did not stop to talk about it, but, with the
Chief and me in the lead, started up the stairs into the
silence and darkness above. The men with us had
torches, and they took these out and flashed them ahead of
us, showing up the walls of a narrow corridor at the top
of the staircase. As we mounted higher we could see
that many closed doors led off this corridor, doors heavily
built and with a certain forbidding quality, although the
latter may have been only my imagination.</p>

<p>At any rate we passed into the corridor without
incident, and the Chief set the two men with us to breaking
down the doors as we came to them.</p>

<p>On this floor too, rooms, intersecting passages and
unexpected entrances formed a positive maze, leading a man
sometimes far afield and sometimes back to his
starting-place, none the wiser. However, if one of the men with
us was away exploring for more than a moment or two, the
Chief blew his whistle and guided him back again. But
for the first few moments it seemed as though we were the
only living things on that floor.</p>

<p>However, we had a stroke of luck at last. One of the
Chief’s men was struggling with a small, heavy and
heavily secured door a little way along a side passage, when
I heard a commotion in that direction which set my blood
racing. For there was no mistaking the rich brogue of
that bitterly denunciatory voice.</p>

<p>“Do but let me out av ut, ye divils,” I heard in tones
almost tearful with rage, “and I’ll tache ye. Do but lave
me get my hands on ye——”</p>

<p>I jumped forward and joined the man at the door.
“Larry,” I called, “is that you?”</p>

<p>There came a distinctly audible gasp from behind the
door. “Shur, sor, is that yersilf? I thought it was thim
dirty knav—— But did they get ye, too, sor? Can ye
let me out to ye and we’ll go after thim together.”</p>

<p>“Hold on, Larry,” I answered, stifling a strong desire
to burst out laughing, partly with relief to find him alive
and partly at his simple philosophy, “hold on and we’ll get
you out of it in a minute. We’ve taken the place and
all’s well.”</p>

<p>A moment or two later the lock snapped and the door
swung open, and a wild-eyed, wildly disheveled and almost
naked Larry burst out upon us.</p>

<p>In a rushing spate of words he told us that they had
as good as tortured him to glean the facts about myself
and my connection with the Secret Service. But there
was little that he did know and he had not told that.
However, he had been locked up ever since they took
him, and he had seen no one of our friends in the place.
He was painfully apologetic about Natalie, but I deferred
that explanation until our work was over. And with
Larry in our wake we took up our search again. I had
a warm glow in my heart, though, to find that nothing
had happened to the beggar, for I was fonder of Larry
than I had realized until after his capture.</p>

<p>At the end of the original corridor we found a heavy
door, and beneath the edge of it a steady light was
shining. We came upon it suddenly, as the corridor took
a sharp turn at this point.</p>

<p>When the Chief saw the light he held us back by
putting out his arms. One of the men flashed his torch
on to the lock, and we saw that the key was in the door
and on our side. But the sight of the light made us
hesitate for a moment.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, I leaned over to the Chief and
whispered in his ear. “Chief, this must be just about over
the room of the voices. We turned to the left once, you
know, and then to the right again. And we’ve gone just
about that far.”</p>

<p>“By Jove, you’re right,” the Chief whispered back.
“Well, here goes, anyway!” And he stepped forward,
tried the handle gently and then abruptly flung open the
door.</p>

<p>Our eyes had grown accustomed to the darkness, and
the bright light revealed by the open door blinded us for
a moment. But as we grew accustomed to the glare we
realized that we were staring into a regular laboratory.
Glass jars, retorts, burners, queer-looking glass vessels and
huge metal tanks something like those used for compressed
air lined the walls on all four sides. And there were other
types of apparatus with which I was totally unfamiliar.</p>

<p>But we had no time and no inclination for studying
the inert contents of the room. For in the center of the
floor stood a figure, impassively facing us, that struck a
distinct chill to my heart at least. And by the way the
others stopped in their tracks, I imagine they felt the
same.</p>

<p>It was the figure of a man, tightly bandaged from
neck to foot in black silk, so that only the face showed.
But such a face!</p>

<p>Without the eyes, the thin, pallid countenance, hairless
and deeply lined, seemed to express an abysmal
melancholy, but a melancholy that held no human warmth. The
mouth was thin and wide, the nose high arched and almost
hooked, and the cheekbones unusually high. The face
shadowed forth, to me at least, standing, staring in the
doorway, inhuman composure, inhuman cruelty out of
sheer indifference rather than sensuality, and an inhuman
weariness.</p>

<p>But beneath heavy brows looked out eyes that caused
the rest of the strange countenance to pale into
insignificance. They were pale blue eyes, I think, and they had
the flat quality of unglazed china. But in their depths
leapt and glowed a strength, a force and a relentless
ambition and conscious power that kept us standing there
like a pack of children.</p>

<p>The pale eyes swept over us slowly, lingering on my
face and then slowly swerving to the Chief. In that
moment eye to eye I confess I felt an absurd desire to find a
hole somewhere, crawl into it and pull it in after me. For
the man’s gaze was positively hypnotic. But the moment
his eyes left mine for the Chief, I tore my own eyes
away from his face to his body and so broke the spell.</p>

<p>Each limb was wrapped tightly in spiral turns of
soft black silk, and the same individual material and
arrangement swathed his body. But limbs and body
were slight enough and this style of dress enhanced this
smallness. A moment after his eyes left mine he
spoke—and we stood silent like children and listened.</p>

<p>“Ah, ——,” he said slowly, addressing the Chief by
name, “so you have found me. Clayton was a good man
for you because he is—fortunate. If it had not been for
his good fortune and the fact that I was—badly served,
the positions would certainly have been reversed—and
before long. However, you have broken into my poor
house and—I must leave it. Have you anything to say
to me before I go?”</p>

<p>The Chief took a step forward, and I saw him shake
himself roughly as though to throw off the effect of
the man’s personality. “We’ll talk about that presently,”
he said roughly. “Do you surrender?”</p>

<p>A slow smile crept over the face of the man before
us, a smile so utterly mirthless and inhuman that I
instinctively drew back at the sight of it. “Surrender?”
he answered slowly. “I shall never do that, to you or
any man. But I have been badly served here, and I am
fatigued with the dense stupidity of man. To-night I
am—going elsewhere—but not with you. Have you
anything further to say?”</p>

<p>The Chief drew his revolver and pointed it at the still
figure. “Throw up your hands!” he shouted hoarsely,
“or I’ll shoot you down like a dog!” And it seemed to
me that the Chief’s voice shook a little in spite of him
But no words could ever fully describe the inhuman
quality and the amazing sense of power which emanated
from this black figure, standing quietly before us. It
was no wonder that Ivanovitch and Vining, two such
dissimilar types, had been willing to serve this so-called
Emperor of theirs. I do not blame the Chief in the least,
for I felt just the same, only probably more so.</p>

<p>The man in black slowly folded his arms, smiling
slightly. “Shoot, then,” he laughed. “It will be
amusing!”</p>

<p>The muscles tightened all over my body in
anticipation of the coming shot. But for some reason the Chief
stood there, staring at the figure, and pointing his revolver
still, but making no apparent attempt to pull the trigger.</p>

<p>The Chief told me afterwards that he had hesitated
out of sheer curiosity and a desire to take the man alive
and learn more about his plans. Perhaps that is true,
or perhaps this Emperor succeeded in hypnotizing his
enemy and rendering him powerless to shoot. I know
that I would have hesitated to shoot, in his place, out of
sheer respect for power.</p>

<p>But there was one member of our party who had
suffered at this man’s hands and who was actuated by
no such scruples. There was a little pause, as I have
said, and then suddenly Larry leapt forward, slipped the
revolver out of the Chief’s hand and sent three shots in
quick succession into the figure before us.</p>

<p>The banging of the revolver echoed in the room, to
the accompaniment of a crash of falling glass, and the
figure disappeared as though it had dissolved into thin
air. We had been staring into a rimless, skillfully arranged
mirror. The man with whom we had been talking had
been close beside us in the room on the other side of a
screen and had projected his voice in some way to come
from the vicinity of the mirror.</p>

<p>All this we realized far quicker than it takes to tell
it. And with a roar of rage the Chief dashed into the
room, with us at his heels. At the same moment there
came a hollow, contemptuous laugh from the side of the
room and a door opened and closed again quickly.</p>

<p>Without waiting to call directions to his men this time,
the Chief dashed for this door and attempted to snatch
it open. It resisted his efforts, and I stepped back a
little so that he could open it with his jemmy. But the
Chief was too much in earnest to stop even for that. He
too stepped back. And then he flung himself at that door
like a full-back two yards from the goal.</p>

<p>One of the panels gave way with a loud crack and the
Chief stuck his hand through the hole left by the panel
and unlocked the door from the other side.</p>

<p>“Come on,” he shouted, and he jerked open the door
and flung himself through it, with me close behind him.
Then he cried out and I heard the thud of a heavy fall.
The next moment I realized that there was no floor in the
darkness beneath my feet.</p>

<p>I began to tumble head over heels down a flight of
stairs in the darkness, bringing up against a door at the
bottom with a bang that shook the breath out of me.
And it seemed to me, during that fall, that every time I
touched a step it was either on my head where the bullet
had creased me, or on my wounded shoulder. I know that
it was the shoulder that hit the door at the bottom first.</p>

<p>The Chief had come to a stop just before me. Indeed
he partly broke my fall. He jumped to his feet at once
and started fumbling with this second door, but in spite
of his haste I could hear him chuckling to himself over
my few well-chosen remarks about those stairs and that
door.</p>

<p>A moment later there came another crack and this
second door flew open like the first. I rolled out into
the open air, beneath the open sky, and jumped to my
feet.</p>

<p>The Chief caught my arm. “There he goes,” he
shouted. Then he started to run into the night.</p>

<p>Sure enough, in the starlight I could make out a figure
walking quickly away from us. At the Chief’s shout it
began to run. And taking a long breath I began to run
also.</p>

<p>The man ahead ran on for perhaps a hundred feet or
so and then suddenly darted into the doorway of a low
stone building. As the Chief and I drew closer, I gave
a sudden shout, for I remembered that low building only
too well. It was the place in which I had been
imprisoned and in which I had killed Ivanovitch and his
satellite.</p>

<p>We had gained rapidly on the figure ahead during that
run, and the latter had had to pause to get the door open,
so that we were close behind him when he finally
disappeared into the building. He slammed the door in our
faces, but it did not lock. We got it open almost at
once, and as it swung outward, a dazzling glare sprang
up from the middle of the room beyond. The cylinder
there had suddenly flashed into dazzling fire.</p>

<p>I shaded my eyes as well as I could from the glare,
and presently I realized that a man was crouching in
a corner by the big machine which operated the cylinder.
But the glare held us stationary on the threshold for a
moment, and while we hesitated, the man by the machine
darted forward and flung open the side of the cylinder
which opened toward us. In the bright light I could
see the swathed black silk about the slender limbs.</p>

<p>Before the searing heat that sprang out at us the Chief
and I shrank back a step or two. At the same moment the
man we pursued sent forth a wailing shriek that I shall
remember as long as I live and suddenly leapt through the
opening into the heart of the cylinder.</p>

<p>For an instant our straining eyes saw him glow
suddenly red and almost transparent, in a bower of leaping,
licking flames. Then we turned hastily away. When we
looked back again, only the glowing cylinder and the
searing heat remained.</p>

<p>As the miserable man leapt into the cylinder there had
come a rush of feet from behind us. And I recovered
from the shock of such a terrible death to the
consciousness that some one was plucking at my arm.</p>

<p>“Clayton! Clayton! And you, Chief! For God’s
sake come away! Come out! Quick!” It was Moore’s
voice.</p>

<p>We turned and stumbled out of the building in
response to the urgency in Moore’s tone. But we had taken
hardly three steps from the door when there came a
tremendous flash of light, followed by a roar that seemed to
shake the world. With it, something crashed against my
chest and I fell to the ground.</p>

<p>“Chief,” I called faintly, “get Natalie——” and then
darkness swooped down upon me.</p>

<hr>

<p>I have a vague recollection of regaining at least partial
consciousness some time later. I seemed to be lying full
length on a couch in a brightly lighted room, and I was
struggling in some way with a racking, searing agony in
my chest. It seemed to me, too, that Natalie was kneeling
beside me, her lovely face pressed close to mine.</p>

<p>But it was only a vague impression before I plunged
back and down again into terrible, endless darkness.</p>

<h2>Chapter XXVI. <br> The Final Surprise</h2>

<p>It seemed to me that I was struggling up through
miles of deep blue water that gradually turned to
lighter emerald. Huge sea monsters swam lazily
about me, staring with curious, lackluster eyes. I fought
on, in a panic to rise above them, and broke surface at
last with a splash. But when I opened my eyes I was
lying in a narrow white bed in a hospital room. An old
man with a long beard bent over me, and beside him
stood a nurse clad in white.</p>

<p>I stared at the old fellow curiously and he nodded at
me.</p>

<p>“Feeling better, eh?” he asked.</p>

<p>I tried to fill my lungs with air, but desisted hurriedly
at the stab of pain that shot through me. “What’s the
matter with me?” I demanded.</p>

<p>The doctor laughed. “Nothing much. You’ve got
five broken ribs and a broken breastbone. You’ve got
a bullet wound in the shoulder that you neglected
shamefully and another in the scalp. Otherwise you’re as
healthy as possible.” He shook his head. “You’ve had
the narrowest kind of a narrow escape, young man.
You’ll pull through now if you take care. But no jumping
about and no hasty movements until those ribs grow
together again. We put you straight on the operating table
and that’s all done with.” He turned to the nurse. “He’ll
do now, nurse.”</p>

<p>The girl drew him aside and whispered a moment,
and presently the doctor returned to my side.</p>

<p>“There are about nineteen people outside waiting to
see you. If I let one or two of them in, will you keep
quiet and be careful?”</p>

<p>“I sure will,” I told him.</p>

<p>He turned away and spoke to the nurse again. “Not
more than two,” I heard him say. Then they both went
out.</p>

<p>I lay waiting in a fever of impatience. But in a
moment the door opened again and I was able to feast my
eyes on the two prettiest girls in New York, even if I
dared not hug them.</p>

<p>There were a few preliminary remarks on both sides
which need not be repeated here. And then I put a
question.</p>

<p>“Peggy, dear, did they treat you pretty well? Are
you all right again?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, Jack.” Margaret nodded brightly. “They
frightened me a good deal, and once they beat me, as
I told you, but that was all. They didn’t mistreat us much
because they said that we had to keep our looks.”</p>

<p>I groaned, and in spite of myself my eyes sought
Natalie’s face. She met my glance frankly. “I’m all
right too, Jack,” she answered, and with that answer a
great content settled over my heart. They had been
through a terrible experience. But they would both
forget!</p>

<p>When the first excitement of our meeting had worn
off a little, which it speedily did under the watchful and
reproving eye of the nurse, I begged the two of them to
sit down and tell me some of the news that I wanted to
hear.</p>

<p>So they drew up chairs, possessed themselves of one of
my hands apiece and prepared to be interrogated.</p>

<p>“First of all, I want to know how they captured you in
the first place, Margaret?”</p>

<p>My little sister made a face, wrinkling up her little
nose until she looked entirely adorable. “Why, I went
into that store, you know, to buy you a present. I had
only been there a minute when that Mr. Vining came up
to me and said that Mrs. Furneau had sent him for me.
He said that Mrs. Furneau had had to move her car
away from the front of the store and that she would
have trouble with the police unless she went away very
soon. He had been passing and she had sent him in, after
describing me to him.</p>

<p>“Of course I didn’t suspect anything, and when he
led me out the side door into a side street, I looked
around for Mrs. Furneau’s car. But he was talking all
the time and he led me up to the door of a car before I
ever looked. Then before I could turn back or ask any
questions, he pushed me into the car, another man grabbed
me and put his hand over my mouth and the car started.
They kept me bound and gagged and blindfolded all the
time until finally they untied me in that terrible house.
Ever since then I’ve been dancing for them at their parties.
But they treated me pretty well, except for that one night.
And I knew you’d come for me sooner or later.”</p>

<p>I turned to Natalie. “Will you ever forgive me for
sending you off in that taxi?” I asked her.</p>

<p>Her smile was answer enough. “Poor Larry,” she
answered. “He did his best that night. But the taxi
stopped in the Park and two men yanked open the doors
before I even knew what was going on. Your man got
his revolver out and fired at one of them a couple of times,
but the man on the other side knocked it out of his hand
and they climbed into the taxi and dragged him out. I
tried to get out and run away, but another man caught me,
picked me up and bundled me into another car. Then
they tied me up and gagged me and took me to that awful
place. I saw your sister almost at once, but of course I
did not know she <em>was</em> your sister until afterwards. Oh,
Jack——”</p>

<p>But at this point the nurse came up and kindly but
firmly informed them that they must go. Margaret
stooped over and kissed me, and, in spite of a stifled giggle
from Margaret, Natalie did the same. A moment later
they were gone.</p>

<p>I was not allowed to see any one the rest of that day,
nor the next, owing to a rise in temperature, induced,
according to the doctor, by my first visitors.</p>

<p>But on the third day I was much better, and the doctor
informed me that arrangements had been made to move
me to my own apartment, where I was to be put in charge
of a trained nurse. Mrs. Furneau took charge of the
moving, accompanied by Natalie, Margaret and Moore,
but I had no chance to talk to them till later, as I was
pretty tired after the trip.</p>

<p>The day after the move, however, Moore came in to
see me and we shook hands with expressions of mutual
esteem. I guess we were pretty glad to see each other
again.</p>

<p>After the first few remarks, Moore plunged into an
account of his adventures after he had been captured
that day. It seemed that he, too, was taken straight to
the house on Long Island and put through a sort of Third
Degree in the room of the voices. It must have been
pretty bad, for he did not want to talk about it much.
But I found out that the Emperor would ask him a
question, and when Moore refused to answer, they turned on
some other sort of gas and put him to sleep, waking him
up, violently sick, and questioning him again.</p>

<p>When they realized at last that they could get nothing
out of him, they told Moore, who was pretty well all in
by that time, that the next time the gas was turned on he
would not wake up at all. But just before they turned
it on, and while Moore was bracing himself for the end,
his tormentors asked him casually whether he knew
anything about mechanics and electricity.</p>

<p>Grasping at a straw, Moore admitted that he was an
electrical engineer. Whereupon he was put to sleep
by the kind of gas used on me, but woke up again to find
himself in a cell in the same building in which they had
locked me up. Later, they let him see part of the
apparatus which worked the cylinder, although he was never
allowed to study the thing sufficiently to get a clear
understanding of the nature of the fierce rays.</p>

<p>However, he was able to make certain adjustments
that were needed, and he was retained as the house
electrician after that. A few days later he was allowed, under
supervision, to make the electrical preparations for a
Japanese fête. He was loose in the building with his
guard the night we attacked. His guard was killed at the
start and Moore lay low until things quieted down. Then
he came out to try to find me, saw us start for the room of
the cylinder and ran after us to warn us, for he had
discovered the electrical arrangement for blowing up the little
stone house in case of an attack. It had been a bar from
one of the windows of that house that had crushed in my
ribs.</p>

<p>But, Moore said, no one had been able to find any
trace of the man Clark, who had disappeared early in
the search, of the young man about town who had given
Moore his first clew that night on Riverside Drive, nor,
finally, of Pride. Nor has anything ever been learned of
these three.</p>

<p>The loss of Pride was a bitter blow to all of us. The
man gave up his life, I believe, to trace me that night,
probably putting up a fight after his car smashed up
and getting killed in the process. None of us will ever
forget him. Whatever death he died, I know and we all
know that it was a good death. All honor to him and
may he sleep soundly. The Chief and Moore and I have
lost a friend that we can never replace.</p>

<p>Later, when the earlier report of my death had been
contradicted, I had other visitors, and I began to learn
more about what had happened after the big drug raid,
as the papers called it.</p>

<p>The whole country rang with the affair for a while, as
every one will remember. But owing to the importance
of the people who were at the house that night, or who
were found to be connected with the gang, and the
position of many of the girls who were rescued, very few of
the details got into the papers. The little book I took
from Vining’s flat was found among the Emperor’s papers.
The names in it, mostly of persons in high social positions,
referred to people whom the Emperor had got into his
toils, through drugs, and to whom he had been supplying
drugs regularly, to keep them under his thumb. The
numbers after their names referred to supplies of these
drugs.</p>

<p>The girls in the gardens, of whom there were some ten
or twelve, were young Russian girls, smuggled into this
country, and were mostly peasants. I never heard what
became of them.</p>

<p>As for Mrs. Fawcette, she was taken to her town house
and quietly buried from there. Nothing more was ever
said about the manner of her death, although the others
know now.</p>

<p>The girl who was my dinner companion that first night
in the Emperor’s house came to visit me too. And since
then she has become a close friend of Margaret’s and
mine, as have some of the others whom Margaret saw at
that house.</p>

<p>The Secret Service alone knew of the extent of the
organization which that strange man, the Emperor, had
built up about him. After the smash, the mortality,
through suicide, among men and women prominent both
socially and politically, was simply appalling. But the
Department of Justice kept its own counsel and no one
else ever knew how many of these people were connected
with the Emperor’s organization, and how many were
simply his victims who had become drug addicts and had
committed suicide when the supply was cut off. And of
course some of such deaths may have been coincidences.
I am not intending to imply that any one who died
suddenly at that time was necessarily involved. But it is
certain that many such people were.</p>

<p>There were many other details, however, which we were
all curious to know. And after some difficulty, Moore at
length succeeded in persuading the Chief to come to a
little dinner at my apartment. This was after I was well
enough to sit up.</p>

<p>When the night finally came, there were quite a lot of
us gathered around my table. Of course Natalie,
Margaret, Moore and Larry were there and the Chief. But
in addition we had invited Natalie’s aunt and Mrs.
Furneau. I had long since explained to the former the
reason for my rudeness over the telephone.</p>

<p>Natalie had given me permission to announce our
engagement that night at the dinner. I had done so, and
relaxed nerves and the lifting of the cloud of the last few
months had made them all pretty noisy and
inconsequential over their congratulations to me. But after Larry
had set the coffee on the table and had at last consented
to take a chair between Margaret and me, for he
worshiped my little sister and positively became her slave,
we settled back in our seats and waited for the Chief’s
story. I started him off with a question.</p>

<p>“Chief,” I said, “we’re all pretty anxious to get at the
truth of this queer thing we’ve been up against. But what
I want to know more particularly is what idea the man
had, why he called himself an Emperor, why he dabbled
in drugs, and why he stole the girls and ran that place at
all. It seems to me that he was running his neck into a
noose for nothing.”</p>

<p>The Chief laughed.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll tell you most of the details that we have
learned about the man and his gang, and you can draw
your own conclusions.</p>

<p>“In the first place, he was a Russian aristocrat who
turned renegade to his class under the Bolshevik régime,
and was given command of a big commune somewhere in
Eastern Russia after the defeat of Kolchak. We have
traced him back that far, through one of his men whom
we captured. The fellow would not talk at all until we
assured him that this Emperor of his was dead. And
even then we had to drag the details out of him. The
Emperor, as he called himself, seems to have had a
tremendous personality. My own view is that he was
mad.”</p>

<p>“Was the whole thing the dream of a madman then?”
asked Natalie.</p>

<p>“Perhaps so, Miss Van Cleef,” answered the Chief.
“But there was a lot of method in his madness, I’ll say
that for him.</p>

<p>“It seems that he was a traitor to every one but
himself. He was a man of immense wealth before the
Revolution. He saw the Revolution coming and salted a good
deal of his wealth away in the form of valuable drugs,
jewels and minerals. It seems that he had extensive
connections in Siberia before and after the Revolution, and
he had built up a considerable trade in opium smuggled
into China. He had also refined the manufacture of
synthetic drugs to an extent that had never been equaled,
importing them from Germany and refining them.
Besides all that, he was a mechanical and electrical engineer
of no mean order.</p>

<p>“When the Revolution came, he retained his liberty by
joining the Bolsheviki, even, apparently, gaining a high
place in their councils. Later he came to America, either
with affiliations with the Bolsheviks or actually as their
accredited agent, for the purpose of bringing about a
Bolshevik Revolution in this country.”</p>

<p>“Great Scott,” I said, “was that what he was after?”</p>

<p>The Chief laughed. “Wait. It seems that that was
only part of it. From what we can learn from his papers
and from the men he had under him, his dream was a
greater dream than that.</p>

<p>“He had no intention of acting as an agent of the
Bolsheviks. He was a man who believed implicitly in the
inherent wickedness of mankind—that every man and
woman has his or her price—and he set himself, on that
assumption, to obtain a power which should eventually
rival that of Napoleon. And,” the Chief added, leaning
forward in his seat, “he had gone quite a respectable way
toward realizing his dream!”</p>

<p>We stared at him in genuine amazement this time.</p>

<p>“Yes,” the big man went on. “He had two methods,
desire and intimidation. He came to this country
originally with immense wealth in his possession or at his
disposal. He brought a big stock of drugs with him, which
we have found, by the way. And since then he had been
importing synthetic drugs into this country from Germany
in large quantities.”</p>

<p>“I noticed an article on that subject in <i>The Times</i> some
time in November,” I interrupted. “I noticed it because
it told of the amount of synthetic drugs being smuggled
to America from Germany.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” the Chief nodded. “The Germans perfected the
manufacture of synthetic drugs during the war and they
keep our hands full. But this man did not use, nor
intend to use, his drugs merely to gain wealth. He had a
bigger motive. It was power he wanted, colossal power,
and he was in a fair way toward getting it when we finally
stopped him.</p>

<p>“He bought that house out there on Long Island,
refitted it with all kinds of luxuries and electrical devices,
and prepared to sit back in his web and wait for his
victims. His gang was already organized, and at least four
of his principal lieutenants were men—or women—with
a good social <i>entrée</i>. These acted as decoys and brought
the influential people, with whom the Emperor wanted to
get in touch, to the man’s parties. Here they were given
a wonderful time and were skillfully and thoroughly
drugged. To give real parties of that kind he had, of
course, to secure beautiful women—hence his method of
kidnaping beautiful girls——” and the Chief bowed very
handsomely to Natalie, who flushed and returned the
courtesy prettily.</p>

<p>“Just there is where the man’s personality came in.
Sometimes he would talk to his victims about life as it
is to-day, and his idea of what it should be and could be
if a few resolute men made up their minds to make it so.
And in this way he actually enlisted quite a number of
persons, mostly women, in his scheme for establishing a
modern Utopia in these United States, with every man
making his own laws and a free-and-easy life, love and
religion for every one.</p>

<p>“Of course he had no such idea in his mind, except
perhaps at first, with himself as head or Emperor. But he
got these people eating out of his hand—Mrs. Fawcette
was one of them—and they brought others. And among
the others were often men of real power and influence
whom the Emperor succeeded either in enlisting in his
cause, blackmailing or drugging. If they were men in
important political positions, he got secrets out of them
and then blackmailed them. Or he threatened to destroy
their public lives for them unless they did as he wanted.</p>

<p>“But his safest and most effective method was to drug
his victims so subtly and with such skillfully prepared
drugs that they acquired the drug habit and the drug
hunger before they were aware of it. Then, as he was the
only source of supply, they would do anything he told
them to, to get some more of the same.”</p>

<p>“But surely,” Moore interrupted, “you don’t believe
that he could have got away with anything like that for
long, do you, sir?”</p>

<p>The Chief shook his head, “I don’t know, Moore,” he
answered. “Nobody would have dreamed that Napoleon
could get away with what he did get away with. And
immense wealth means immense power in the world of
to-day, as the history of Hugo Stinnes in Germany shows.
Without a doubt this Emperor was a little mad—perhaps
more than a little. But who can say where genius ends
and madness begins? And the man was an organizing
genius, an electrical genius, an executive genius in his
power over men, had a genius for making money and was
an expert chemist. What is more, he had a big vision,
such as it was. And that is everything.</p>

<p>“From the rambling versions I have been able to get
out of the few of his men who were left alive, he intended
to make his power practically absolute in this country by
the underground methods I have told you. Then,
according to one man, he intended to make himself Emperor
of the World. That was the little plan he had up his
sleeve!”</p>

<p>We all laughed. But when I glanced at the Chief’s
face I was amazed to see that his smile was perfunctory.
Evidently he did not take this Russian’s crazy ambition
quite as lightly as we did. “He was about the most
dangerous customer I’ve run up against in my career,
anyway!” he added, a moment later.</p>

<p>“Tell me, Chief,” I asked him, “how did he manage to
run a place like that without somebody getting on to it?
I’ve been wondering about that. I should think local
people would have noticed all the activity involved in
running such a <i>ménage</i>. Think of the supplies and the
power he used for that big house and that huge staff.”</p>

<p>The Chief laughed. “That puzzled me for a while too.
But he was too clever for that. All his supplies were
brought in by lighter from New York and unloaded on
the beach at night. You saw one party at it. He brought
coal that way too. And he had a big dynamo brought
from New York in the same way for his electric power.
He sent a man to the village for a few small supplies every
little while as a blind.”</p>

<p>“How did he get his supplies, then, into the house?”</p>

<p>“By another underground passage, up that little gully
you saw his men disappearing into. We stopped that hole
the night we made the raid. It was cleverly concealed
with growing bushes and brush. But they aren’t yet
through exploring the place, and we expect to find many
other ‘earths’ before we get through. Acting as an agent
for the Bolshevik Government gave him practically
unlimited men to work for him, and there was little danger
of their talking. These Russians are too good
conspirators for that and so are the Chinese he had brought with
him. They thought that that house was the headquarters
of the future Bolshevik Government in the United States.
The Emperor was a wonder at making people believe what
he wanted them to believe.”</p>

<p>“Funny there were no windows in the place.”</p>

<p>The Chief smiled. “That was clever, too,” he answered,
“He had had an inner shell put in the house, so that the
windows showed from the outside but showed no lights.
It gave the house a deserted appearance, which was just
what he wanted.”</p>

<p>“By the way,” I asked, “what became of that other car
that started out with us?”</p>

<p>Both the Chief and Moore laughed outright at this.
“Well,” said the former, “there’s been a little feeling
about that. It seems that they had only gone a block or
two when they were overtaken by a motor-cycle cop. He
told them that I had sent him with instructions that they
were to proceed at once to Coney Island, as the meeting
place had been changed. What’s more, they went. They
waited awhile, and by the time they suspected that
something was wrong and came back, you and I had gone on.
We never caught the cop either.”</p>

<p>“I never heard what happened to the other fellows
outside that night,” said Moore.</p>

<p>“Oh, they had a pretty warm time. Those fellows that
tried to blow us up on the way down came back and
reported their failure, and the Emperor stationed them
outside the house to wait for us. But of course he thought
there were only the three of us. When our men came in
touch with them there was a battle-royal, the end of
which we saw from the big hall. It’s a good thing that
they drove those fellows in, or our men might have been a
much longer time getting in to us.”</p>

<p>“What became of Vining?” I asked him presently. “Is
he going up for trial soon?”</p>

<p>The Chief stared at me and shook his head slowly.
“He’s gone up for trial already,” he said gravely. “One
of the fool cops out there in —— told him that we had
rounded up the gang and that the head of it was dead.
And the next morning they found Vining hanging by his
own belt from the bars of his window. We had enough
evidence to send him to the chair ten times over anyway.
He took the easier way.”</p>

<p>The rest of the general conversation that night was of
a more personal nature. The Chief had to leave early
and we all trooped out to the elevator to wish him
God-speed. He is a great man, and somehow I feel that I am
destined, perhaps, to work with him again, before I die,
although the thing seems improbable enough. Perhaps
what Moore told me that night just before he left may
have something to do with my feeling.</p>

<p>I had left the others in the sitting-room, intending to
take Natalie and her aunt home later on. I had walked
out to the elevator to say good-night to Moore there. But
before he rang the bell he turned and faced me, smiling a
little.</p>

<p>“Clayton,” he said, “I’ve got a confession to make to
you. I knew Margaret quite a while before I knew you!”</p>

<p>“What!—where?” I demanded.</p>

<p>“In town,” he answered. “I met her several times at
the house of a school friend of hers with whom she was
staying. And, old man, I made up my mind that she was
the only girl in the world for me!”</p>

<p>I could only stare at him with my mouth open and he
hurried on.</p>

<p>“You see, when she disappeared I had been out of the
army for some time and I was looking around for a job.
I have independent means and I was taking my time, but
when I heard about Margaret I hurried down to
Washington and began pulling wires. You see I was in the
Intelligence Department in the Service. And finally I got
the Chief to take me on. I knew that you were doing all
you could to find her outside, and I thought I’d try to find
her that way, for I knew that the Department was up in
the air about the number of girls that had disappeared.</p>

<p>“I did not say anything about it to you then, because
I could not bear to talk about her and I saw no need. But
later, when I realized the danger you were in, I got the
Chief to agree to offer to take you on. The rest you
know.” He hesitated. “But I wanted you to know,
because——”</p>

<p>I held out my hand to him. “It’s up to her of course,
but I don’t know any one I’d rather have for a
brother-in-law,” I told him.</p>

<p>The grip Moore gave my hand caused me to open and
shut it two or three times to see whether anything was
broken. But a moment later he turned to me with a
wry grin.</p>

<p>“Old man,” he said, “I’ve got some other news for you
that may explain the fact that the Chief did not laugh
much to-night when we were discussing the Emperor’s
chances. It’s mean news too.”</p>

<p>I stared at him. “Mean news?”</p>

<p>He nodded. “You remember that night in the little
stone house, just before it was blown up? I was just
behind you when that fellow jumped into the blazing
cylinder, do you remember?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I remember,” I told him.</p>

<p>“Well, you fellows turned away. But I didn’t. And I
saw something that you didn’t—something that I have
told to nobody except the Chief as yet. But I think—and
he thinks—that you are entitled to know it too. And I
have his permission to tell you. The man who jumped
into the cylinder turned an agonized face in my direction
for a moment just before he disappeared. And, Clayton,
it was not the Emperor!”</p>

<p>“What!” I shouted.</p>

<p>Moore shook his head. “I saw the Emperor—twice. It
was the Emperor you talked to, for the Chief has
described him to me. But the man who died in the cylinder
was not he. It was his body servant. The Emperor made
up all that rigmarole about leaving the earth, or whatever
it was. And he hypnotized his servant into going to his
death for him, to put us off the track. I’ve seen the
servant too, and I recognized him.”</p>

<p>“But then—where is he?”</p>

<p>Moore shook his head again. “Got away somehow.
Nobody knows how. But he’s free. His gang is broken
up for some time to come, but the man himself is still at
large. The Chief is scouring the place for him, but so far
without success. That’s why he looked grave to-night.
And—I don’t blame him.”</p>

<p>“We’ve failed after all then.”</p>

<p>Moore smiled and nodded toward the room we had left.
“Hardly that,” he said. “But—the man who calls himself
Emperor has probably taken an unaccountable dislike to
both of us. And—I wanted you to know. That’s all.”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” I told him simply. And with that Moore
took his departure. He was leaving for Washington the
next day.</p>

<hr>

<p>There are just a few words to add.</p>

<p>Natalie and I were married the following spring. And
in the autumn Margaret came to live with us, having
spent her summer with old friends. Of course Larry,
who had simply refused to listen to suggestions as to
finding a better job for him, had been placed in practical
command of our household as soon as Natalie and I
settled down.</p>

<p>Moore gave up his work with the Secret Service about
the time of my marriage, got himself a position with a
firm of consulting engineers in New York, and took to
running in to see us two or three times a week. Of course
I am only a brother and these things are hidden from me.
But although Margaret goes out a good deal and has
many friends, she always seems to be at home when
Moore calls. I hope I’m right!</p>

<p>Of the Emperor, whom Moore and I often discuss, we
have heard nothing more. He was never captured, so far
as we know. But he has never been heard from since
that night.</p>

<p>Possibly he’s gone back to Russia, or some place equally
distant. I hope so!</p>
